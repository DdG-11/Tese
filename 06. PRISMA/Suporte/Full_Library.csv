The analysis and modeling of basketball game data have long been central topics in sports analytics. In recent years, integrating machine learning techniques has facilitated significant advancements in predicting basketball game outcomes. However, most existing studies predominantly focus on NBA data, with relatively limited exploration of other leagues. To address this research gap, this study utilizes game data from the Chinese Basketball Association spanning the 2021–2024 seasons to develop predictive models. This research is the first to apply the classical Four Factors model and DefenseOfense model, along with their derivative versions (Four Factors detailed model and DefenseOfense detailed model), to the Chinese Men’s Professional Basketball League, providing a baseline for prediction. To ensure practical applicability of the models and enable their effective use in real-world scenarios, this study exclusively uses data available before the start of each game as feature variables for training. This approach ensures that the enhanced models can perform well in theoretical evaluations and provide reliable predictions when applied in practice. To evaluate model performance, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron with contrastive loss, and XGBoost are employed, with metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and AUROC used for comparison. The results reveal that the incorporation of additional features substantially enhances predictive performance. In particular, under the Logistic Regression framework, the newly developed model based on the Four Factors detailed achieves an accuracy of 85.49%, representing the highest predictive performance among all the evaluated approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:50:40","2025-09-29 14:53:32","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By merging physiological signals i.e., Heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, muscle activation patterns, with psychological signals i.e., mental toughness, athlete engagement, group cohesion along with contextual training data, we create a hybrid model that performs superiorly as compared to traditional unidimensional models. Our exercisers were trained using a gradient boosting and neural network to learn the very complex non-linear relationships that exist between the physical and the psychological performance drivers. With a rich sample set of 480 athletes from different sports, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) in predicting performance outcomes and outdid the conventional methods with statistical approaches R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) and machine learning based methods (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) And machine whiz methods. The robust results achieved from the model (over 90%) as compared to conventional nor statistical methods. From the analysis of the features’ importance, the strongest predictor of performance are the Provided Dedicated Athletes’ scores of the Functional Movement Screening (13.7%), athlete dedication (11.5%), maximum acceleration capabilities (10.2%), which verify the relationship along biomechanical, preconceived explosive power and psychological commitment. This reflects the finding whereby deep categorized athletic talent prediction requires a multi-dimensional approach by sophisticated fusion techniques. The framework is useful to coaches and sports scientists because it allows for the individualized design of injury risk mitigation and physiologically and psychologically-focused interpersonal help. This approach integrates multiple factors and constitutes an important progress in sports analytics by providing a comprehensive perspective on the complex realities which influence elite athletic performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:50:40","2025-09-29 14:53:55","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current use of vision sensors for HSAR is a difficult task due to the intricate movements involved in sports and fitness workouts, as well as fluctuations in illumination conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) and their usage for human sports activities classification based on sensor data called ML-HSAR is presented in this article. A dataset containing 19 different human activities gathered from 8 different people through different types of sensors was used for this work; the dataset contains activities like sitting and standing, as well as other activities that require serious movements, such as running, cycling, and playing basketball. This study primarily aims to determine the performance of the considered ML models in accurately classifying these activities found in the dataset. The training of the algorithms and the subsequent evaluation were done on the segmented sensor data, effectively leveraging the dataset’s temporal aspect. In addition to the presented results for each of these algorithms, the limitations of each algorithm and their strengths in handling the complexities involved in HSAR were also presented.

Despite notable advancements driven by deep learning approaches, BAR remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of basketball movements, frequent occlusions, and limited availability of standardized benchmark datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured synthesis of current developments in BAR research, encompassing four principal dimensions: dataset curation, computational methodologies, synthetic data generation, and model explainability. A critical analysis of publicly available basketball-specific datasets is presented, delineating their modalities, annotation strategies, action taxonomies, and representational scope. Furthermore, the survey offers a structured classification of state-of-the-art action recognition methodologies, ranging from video-based and skeleton-based models to sensor-driven and multimodal fusion approaches, emphasizing architectural characteristics, evaluation protocols, and task-specific adaptations. The role of synthetic data is systematically examined as a means to address data scarcity, reduce annotation noise, and enhance model generalization through controlled variability and simulation-based augmentation. In parallel, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques is also analyzed, with a focus on post-hoc attribution methods, probabilistic reasoning models, and interpretable neural architectures, aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of decision-making processes. The survey identifies persisting research challenges, including dataset heterogeneity, limitations in cross-domain transferability, and the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in deep models. By delineating current limitations and prospective directions, this work provides a foundational reference to guide the development of robust, generalizable, and explainable BAR systems for deployment in real-world sports intelligence applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:50:40","2025-09-29 14:52:54","","","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>; <p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization.

To develop a predictive model that analyzes technical and tactical decisions in badminton, enhancing strategy development and performance evaluation for competitive gameplay, the proposed method, Puffer Fish Algorithm-tuned Intelligent Support Vector Machine (PFA-INT-SVM), combines the benefits of Pufferfish mutation with INT-SVM to improve prediction accuracy and classification tasks. The model utilizes data that encompasses player performance metrics, shot types, match context, opponent behavior, physical conditions, environmental factors, and tactical decisions. One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features, while normalization standardizes numerical data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that PFA-INT-SVM significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This model effectively predicts player performance and match outcomes, showing promising potential for enhancing badminton strategy development and analysis. The findings highlight the future of integrating machine learning techniques for advanced sports analytics and practical training applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:50:41","2025-09-29 14:54:05","","3637 - 3651","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1</p>; <p>Cited by: 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a real-time goal state recognition system based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, focusing on four shooting scenarios: rebounds, swishes, other shots, and misses. By installing IMU sensors around the basketball net, the system captures real-time data on acceleration, angular velocity, and angular changes to comprehensively analyze the fluency and success rate of shooting execution, utilizing five deep learning models—convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM-Attention—to classify shot types. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM-Attention model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 87.79% in identifying goal states. This result represents a commanding level of real-time goal state recognition, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the model in complex sports environments. This high accuracy not only supports the application of the system in skill analysis and sports performance evaluation but also lays a solid foundation for the development of intelligent basketball training equipment, providing an efficient and practical solution for athletes and coaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:50:41","2025-09-29 14:53:59","","","","12","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SailGP is a relatively new sailing event driven by a passion for speed and innovation. The racing series brings excitement and thrill to the world of sailing that has been relatively unexplored. As a pioneer work in the academic community, our work showcases the power of data-driven approaches in enhancing performance and decision-making at high-performance sailing events. We explore data mining techniques on datasets collected at high-performance sailing events in Bermuda in 2021 and Italy in 2023. By analysing race data, the study aims to gain insights into the relationship between variables such as wind speed, wind direction, foil usage, and daggerboard adjustments, and their impact on boat speed. For a comprehensive understanding, we used three distinct methodologies. Various prediction models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and a stacked model, were employed and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score and mean squared error. The results demonstrate the models’ ability to accurately predict boat speed. Anomaly detection techniques examined boat stability, adding a new chapter to the research. Additionally, we introduced a reinforcement learning approach to identify optimal settings for speed enhancement, representing another new dimension of the study.

The discrete nature of volleyball scores, particularly the number of sets won, aligns well with binomial parameter estimators. While existing literature explores methods such as logistic regression, Bayesian approaches, and machine learning techniques, binomial estimation offers a simpler and more versatile approach that suits various scenarios in practice. This article introduces and compares six estimation methods for volleyball match prediction, all based on modified estimators of the binomial parameter. Simulations were conducted to forecast the outcome of the FIVB Volleyball Women’s Nations League 2023. Our findings indicate that the model using traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) outperforms others, as evidenced by metrics such as Mean Square Error and Kendall’s Tau.

HPE, a fundamental task in applications such as sports analytics and surveillance systems, involves predicting human joint locations from visual data. Despite substantial progress driven by deep learning advancements, particularly in handling occlusions and crowded environments, a comprehensive integration of these innovations remains limited in current literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel HPE and SEC system featuring a robust six-stage pipeline. The workflow begins with preprocessing steps, including video-to-image sequence conversion, floor removal to reduce noise, grayscale transformation, and human silhouette extraction via binary masks. Human detection is performed using the GrabCut algorithm. Full-body feature extraction incorporates 1-D Fourier Transform, 2-D energy-based motion analysis, 0–180° intensity mapping via the Radon Transform algorithm, and movable body part detection using Fourier-Based Correlation. Key point features are characterized through the degree of freedom, human landmark detection via the HSV algorithm, and angular point analysis using the media pipe algorithm.

This paper proposes a novel AI-driven image recognition system for automatically detecting offside and foul events in football matches. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention or traditional image processing techniques, our approach utilizes a hybrid deep learning model that combines advanced object tracking with motion analysis to deliver real-time, precise event detection. The system employs a robust, self-learning algorithm that leverages spatiotemporal features from match footage to track player movements and ball dynamics. By analyzing the continuous flow of video data, the model detects offside positions and identifies foul types such as tackles, handballs, and dangerous play—through a dynamic pattern recognition process. This multi- tiered approach overcomes traditional methods’ limitations by accurately identifying critical events with minimal latency, even in complex, high-speed scenarios. In experiments conducted on diverse datasets of live match footage, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.85% for offside detection and 98.56% for foul identification, with precision rates of 98.32% and 97.12%, respectively. The system's recall rates of 97.45% for offside detection and 96.85% for foul recognition demonstrate its reliability in real-world applications. It's clear from these results that the proposed framework can automate and greatly enhance the accuracy of match analysis, making it a useful tool for both referees and broadcasters. The system's low computational overhead and growing ability make connecting to existing match broadcasting infrastructure easy. This establishes an immediate feedback loop for use during live games.

This task poses significant challenges due to the inherently interactive and unpredictable nature of sports, where abrupt changes in velocity and direction are prevalent. Traditional approaches, including (S)ARIMA(X), Kalman filters (KF), and Particle filters (PF), often struggle to model the non-linear dynamics present in such scenarios. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers, offer greater flexibility and accuracy but frequently fail to explicitly capture the interplay between temporal dependencies and contextual interactions, which are critical in chaotic sports environments.In this paper, we evaluate these models and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results reveal key performance trade-offs across input history length, generalizability, and the ability to incorporate contextual information. ML-based methods demonstrated substantial improvements over linear models across forecast horizons of up to 2s. Among the tested architectures, our hybrid LSTM augmented with contextual information achieved the lowest final displacement error (FDE) of 1.51m, outperforming temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN), graph attention network (GAT), and Transformers, while also requiring less data and training time compared to GAT and Transformers.

This study develops a comprehensive framework to analyze momentum patterns in the 2023 Wimbledon Men's Singles tournament through an integrated approach combining random forest machine learning and TOPSIS methods. The research identifies and evaluates key momentum indicators encompassing player performance metrics, score dynamics, and physical exertion parameters. Our random forest model processes these features to generate initial predictions, which are then refined using the TOPSIS method with entropy-based weighting. The hybrid model, tested across multiple datasets, demonstrates exceptional predictive accuracy with R-squared values of 0.892 for training and 0.845 for testing. Following initial validation, the framework was enhanced by incorporating environmental variables such as court surface characteristics and weather conditions, improving its practical relevance.

By taking into account the factors that contribute to securing one of the top positions in the league standings, coaches are encouraged to adopt ball possession strategies with patience and short passes to create gaps in the opponent’s defense and, at the right moment, execute through balls aiming to enter the attacking third and create goal opportunities. On the other hand, teams are advised to avoid long passes, as these may lead to a loss of team cohesion and create large distances between the lines. Finally, this information is also useful for team scouts in identifying players who are suitable for implementing the aforementioned strategies. Introduction: Performance analysis is essential for coaches and a topic of extensive research. The advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has revolutionized sports analytics. Aim: The primary aim of this article is to present a robust, explainable machine learning (ML) model that identifies the key factors that contribute to securing one of the top three positions in the standings of the French Ligue 1, ensuring participation in the UEFA Champions League for the following season. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from all 380 matches of the 2022–23 French Ligue 1 season. The data were obtained from the publicly-accessed website “whoscored” and included 34 performance indicators. This study employed Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) and various ML algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to create a robust, explainable model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) model was used to enhance model interpretability. Results: The K-means Cluster Analysis categorized teams into groups (TOP TEAMS, 3 teams/REST TEAMS, 17 teams), and the ML models provided significant insights into the factors influencing league standings. The LR classifier was the best-performing classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75.13%, a recall of 76.32%, an F1-score of 48.03%, and a precision of 35.17%. “SHORT PASSES” and “THROUGH BALLS” were features found to positively influence the model’s predictions, while “TACKLES ATTEMPTED” and “LONG BALLS” had a negative impact. Conclusions: Our model provided satisfactory predictive accuracy and clear interpretability of results, which gave useful information to stakeholders. Specifically, our model suggests adopting a strategy during the ball possession phase that relies on short passes (avoiding long ones) and aiming to enter the attacking third and the opponent’s penalty area with through balls. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:41","2025-09-29 14:53:37","","","","18","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 7; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 7; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The models were applied on a filtered pool of 90 high-performance players. This study developed individual forecasting scenarios per player and experimented using all 14 models. The models’ performance ranking was developed using a bespoke evaluation metric, called weighted average percentage error (WAPE), formulated from the weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation results of each forecasted statistic and model. Moreover, we employed a comprehensive forecasting approach to improve KPI's results. Results showed that Tree-based models, namely Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, are the best performers in most of the forecasted performance indicators, with the best performance achieved by Extra Trees with a WAPE of 34.14%.

Analyzing different types of plays (e.g., corner, penalty, free kicks) requires different considerations. This work focuses on the analysis of corner kick plays. However, the central ideas apply to analyzing all types of plays. While prior analyses (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) have explored the link between contextual factors (e.g., match period, type of defensive marking) and the level of success of a corner kick (e.g., shot, shot on goal, goal), there has been no attempt to combine spatiotemporal event data (sequences of ball movements through the field) and contextual information to determine when and how (strategy) a particular type of corner kick play (tactic) is more likely to succeed or not. To address this gap, we propose an approach that (1) transforms spatiotemporal data into an alternative representation suitable for mining sequential patterns, (2) identifies and characterizes the sequential patterns used by offensive teams to move the ball toward the scoring zone (tactics), and (3) extracts contrast patterns to identify under what conditions different tactics result in increased chances of success or failure; we call these conditions strategies. Our results suggest that favorable and unfavorable conditions for tactic application are not the same across different tactics, supporting the argument that there is a benefit in performing an analysis that treats different tactics separately, where spatiotemporal information plays a crucial role. Unlike prior works on the corner kick, our approach can capture how the interaction between multiple contextual factors impacts the outcome of a corner kick. At the same time, the results can be explained to others in natural languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:41","2025-09-29 14:53:22","","","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning clustering and decision tree models, to predict the composition of a winning roster. Our research identified three distinct clusters based on win percentage and the distribution of players across different skill levels. Successful teams typically have more top-tier players and a significant representation of players in the lowest skill level. In contrast, teams that spread their talent across the entire roster are less successful. We have noticed that players with average to above-average skills are notably affected by excessive playing time in the previous game, which leads to decreased performance and potential losses for the team in the next game. Considering the time of year and the gap between games, we recommend prioritizing the rest and recovery of top players, especially in the latter half of the season. It's crucial to ensure that players who are not as skilled as the top players but still make significant contributions to the team maintain consistent performance, especially during the first half of the season. Analyzing height's impact on basketball player performance has revealed practical insights that can empower coaches and management. We found that the shortest and tallest players often perform less than those of average height. Most top performers in the NBA tend to have heights closer to the average. However, for players who frequently operate near the net and encounter numerous rebound opportunities, it is generally preferable to have an average or taller player for slightly enhanced overall performance compared to below-average height players. Teams can use these insights to improve their roster construction and maximize player utilization by coaches from one game to the next. This research provides practical strategies that can be immediately implemented to enhance team performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:41","2025-09-29 14:53:18","","83 - 94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 0</p>; <p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sports analytics is pivotal in developing strategies and preparing players to achieve their best performance. It is especially important for team sports. However, gathering game data from previous game video recordings for sport analytics is time-consuming and tedious for coaches and their assistants. It could take them hours or days to sift through video clips to gather relevant information to prepare for their next game. This manual process called”tagging” in American football is essential to game planning for coaches. Automating this manual process can provide great benefits for teams in reducing the effort for data gathering and increasing the time for practice. Particularly, being able to automatically classify the offensive play formation for each play is crucial for developing game plans. This paper reports on our feasibility study on using machine learning techniques to automate the manual process. We studied offensive play formations extensively and devised an data augmentation strategy to generate realistic data for training and testing of our neural network. Using these synthetic data for training and testing, our neural network achieves an accuracy of 100% in recognizing 25 commonly used play formations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 0</p>; <p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standard pattern recognition methods typically require the collection of data to be centralized, which is quite problematic in terms of privacy and limits the number of available datasets. The FL method is applied as a collaborative approach to training models with distributed datasets where privacy is maintained while the set datasets are augmented to improve the resulting model. Comparison was also made of the FL CNN architecture with that of a conventional centralized structure. The FL model reached a classification accuracy of 92.5%, Precision of 93.2%, and Recall of 91. 8%, and the F1-score was equal to 92. 5%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the centralized model I achieved was 89. 70% for centrepiece agreement and a precision rate of 90. 5%, a recall rate of 88.Therefore, the percentage increases by 5%, and the median and metamorphotic increases by 19%.

This study presents an advanced approach to tackle prediction by considering comprehensive player and game data. This study proposes a hybrid modeling framework that integrates feature engineering with machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Neural Networks, to enhance the accuracy of tackle predictions. Our methodology begins with extensive preprocessing of the dataset, standardizing date formats, handling missing data, and transforming key variables such as player height and weight into more meaningful features like Body Mass Index (BMI). The integration of domain-specific features, including player age, position, and game-related statistics, allows for a more detailed understanding of the factors influencing tackle outcomes. Here, the models are trained and evaluated by using a rigorous train-test split and cross-validation approach, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving superior accuracy and predictive power. Through the use of confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analyses, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

This system can identify deviations from regular patterns, provide alerts, and ensure safety in case of emergencies or potential risks. These solutions enhance quality of life by promoting independent living while offering peace of mind to loved ones and caregivers. Visual impairments have become the chief part of these problems over the past few years. Usually, visually impaired people seek help from others to keep doing their daily tasks. An automated human activity recognition (HAR) technique could enhance a vision-impaired person's transaction activity and safe movement. HAR using deep learning (DL) includes training neural networks to automatically detect and classify various activities carried out by humans based on sensor information. By leveraging DL approaches, the HAR system could accurately identify and classify activities, including sitting, standing, walking, or running, from the information captured by sensors or wearable devices. This system is integral to smart home automation, healthcare, and sports analytics. This study develops an Automated Fractal Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm with Machine Learning based HAR (QSSA-MLHAR) for assisting elderly and visually impaired people. The QSSA-MLHAR technique uses sensory input data to identify human activities in diverse classes. In the QSSA-MLHAR technique, the min-max scalar is primarily used to scale the input data. Besides, the QSSA-MLHAR technique applies a mixed extreme learning machine (M-ELM) model to classify various human actions. The QSSA-based hyperparameter tuning process is used to improve the detection results of the M-ELM system. A wide range of simulations was performed to ensure the better performance of the QSSA-MLHAR method. The comprehensive outcomes assured that the QSSA-MLHAR technique performs well compared to other models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:22","","","","9-10","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1</p>; <p>Cited by: 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, robust real-time activity recognition remains elusive for rapid-paced sports like table tennis due to the complexity of strokes and quick maneuvering. This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization. Our proposed model outperformed the latest models in this field with higher accuracy, recall values, F1-score, and precision. While expanding the dataset diversity and testing variations of deep network architectures could further enhance performance, this paper demonstrates a crucial leap toward helping real-time analytics in table tennis using an AI-powered computer vision approach. The hybrid system combining IoT, wearables, and machine learning establishes a framework to transform data into actionable and timely insights for table tennis players and coaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:52:28","","339 - 362","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 11</p>; <p>Cited by: 11</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent study applied Random Forest algorithm to identify important variables to classify rugby league players into academy and senior levels and achieved 82.0% and 67.5% accuracy for backs and forwards. However, the classification accuracy could be improved due to limitations in the existing method. Therefore, this study aimed to introduce and implement feature selection technique to identify key performance indicators in rugby league positional groups and assess the performances of six classification algorithms. Fifteen and fourteen of 157 performance indicators for backs and forwards were identified respectively as key performance indicators by the correlation-based feature selection method, with seven common indicators between the positional groups. Classification results show that models developed using the key performance indicators had improved performance for both positional groups than models developed using all performance indicators. 5-Nearest Neighbour produced the best classification accuracy for backs and forwards (accuracy = 85% and 77%) which is higher than the previous method’s accuracies.

The paper proposes a new deep learning-based prediction approach for One Day International (ODI) cricket, using Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with an attention mechanism. While traditional machine learning-based models have shown some promise, they still suffer from the inability to capture long-term dependencies within a cricket match sequential data. The LSTM architecture inherently tends to learn these temporal patterns really well; hence, it is particularly suited for this task. The attention mechanism further enhances this model, where the critical moments in the match are solely responsible for the outcome. Based on this, detection will be done with an extensive dataset covering more than matches of various cricket formats: ODI, T20I, and Test matches. The dataset is a collection from ESPNcricinfo and other official cricket databases, including ball-by-ball information with relevant contextual features: performance metrics from teams, player statistics, weather conditions, and venue information. With this great performance, it was much higher than the best performance of traditional machine learning approaches by as high as 94%.

A large dataset of 14,146 serves from 97 Davis Cup doubles matches played between 2010 and 2019 was analyzed using explainable AI techniques. The angle and distance from the bounce to the sidelines of the serves were found to best distinguish the points won with aces from rallies lasting more than three strokes. Optimal serve angle ranges of 5.7–8.7° substantially increased the probability of serving an ace by over 80%, compared to around 30% when serving used more central angles. Lateral bounce distances of 0–28 cm from the sidelines also boosted the ace probability by over 50%. The serve speed was shown to have less influence on serve effectiveness as compared to singles tennis, with velocities above 187 km h<sup>−1</sup> only increasing the probability of serving an ace by 10%. These findings have important practical implications for the tactical decision-making and technical training of serves in men’s professional doubles tennis. The data highlight that the angle and placement of serves are more important than velocity for attaining effective serves in doubles. Coaches and players can use this knowledge to pay special attention to the most important variables in the effectiveness of serves, such as the line distance and angle, in order to maximize the performance of the doubles serve.

For the analysis, data were collected from 812 completed matches played between 2008 and 2020. Initially, several candidate features were identified, and then the LASSO method was applied as a feature selection technique to identify the most important set of features. Based on the identified important features, predictions are provided for each stage of a match where a T20 match can consist of a maximum of 240 stages. For each stage, three classification models were formed using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. The prediction accuracy was used for evaluating the findings of the study, and the prediction accuracy of each model indicates the ratio between the number of correctly predicted instances and the total number of predicted instances. Naive Bayes demonstrated prediction accuracies ranging from 53.08% to 91.76% between the first and the 240th stage of matches, whereas the accuracy of Logistic Regression varied from 56.92% to 97.65%. In comparison, Support Vector Machines also displayed comparable outcomes with a prediction accuracy of 55.00% at the first stage, and 90.59% at the 240th stage. Furthermore, a strategy generator that assists the competing teams in the second innings to devise winning strategies, is presented in this study alongside an interactive web-based application for making in-game predictions, and for assisting the end users (players and coaching/managing staff) in decision making, based on the generated winning strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:39","","2216 - 2229","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 2</p>; <p>Cited by: 2</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the application of deep learning to improve badminton athletes' performance faces challenges related to identifying weaknesses, generating winning suggestions, and validating strategy effectiveness. These challenges arise due to the limited availability of realistic environments and agents. This paper aims to address these research gaps and make contributions to the badminton community. To achieve this goal, we propose a closed-loop approach consisting of six key components: Badminton Data Acquisition, Imitating Players' Styles, Simulating Matches, Optimizing Strategies, Training Execution, and Real-World Competitions. Specifically, we developed a novel model called RallyNet, which excels at imitating players' styles, allowing agents to accurately replicate real players' behavior. Secondly, we created a sophisticated badminton simulation environment that incorporates real-world physics, faithfully recreating game situations. Thirdly, we employed reinforcement learning techniques to improve players' strategies, enhancing their chances of winning while preserving their unique playing styles. By comparing strategy differences before and after improvement, we provide winning suggestions to players, which can be validated against diverse opponents within our carefully designed environment. Lastly, through collaborations with badminton venues and players, we apply the generated suggestions to the players' training and competitions, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we continuously gather data from training and competitions, incorporating it into the closed-loop cycle to refine strategies and suggestions.

These techniques enable sports analysts to evaluate player performance more effectively. A literature review of player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A novel framework was proposed to evaluate batsman strength based on individual performance, role in the team, and team interactions. Traditionally, proposed ranking systems are derived from static networks, that is, the aggregation of game results over time. However, the scores of the players (or teams) fluctuate over time. Intuitively, defeating a renowned player during peak performance is more rewarding than defeating the same player during other periods. To account for this, we propose a new method and apply it to the T20 format Indian Premier League. The method serves three main purposes: First, it creates a new performance index for players to rank them more accurately and effectively. Second, the players are clustered based on their expertise. In the third phase, a social network analysis approach is applied to visualize and analyze crickets as a network to gain better insights into players’ team interactions. This novel approach is a helpful index for sports coaches, analysts, cricket fans, and managers to evaluate player performance and rank for future aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:48","","158 - 173","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 3; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 3; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, one of the major challenges is the difficulty of automated acquisition of continuous movement data during sports matches. In particular, it is a conundrum to reliably track a tiny ball on a wide soccer pitch with obstacles such as occlusion and imitations. Tackling the problem, this paper proposes an inference framework of ball trajectory from player trajectories as a cost-efficient alternative to ball tracking. We combine Set Transformers to get permutation-invariant and equivariant representations of the multi-agent contexts with a hierarchical architecture that intermediately predicts the player ball possession to support the final trajectory inference. Also, we introduce the reality loss term and postprocessing to secure the estimated trajectories to be physically realistic. The experimental results show that our model provides natural and accurate trajectories as well as admissible player ball possession at the same time. Lastly, we suggest several practical applications of our framework including missing trajectory imputation, semi-automated pass annotation, automated zoom-in for match broadcasting, and calculating possession-wise running performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:23","","4296 - 4307","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 4; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 4; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It contributes to exciting and unpredictable play, which can help teams to overcome defensive strategies and create scoring opportunities. Consequently, evaluating the creative abilities of players is an important aspect of the player recruitment process. However, there is currently no clear way to measure creativity in soccer. It is not captured by the typical result-based performance indicators, as being creative entails going beyond just doing something useful, to accomplishing something useful but in a unique or atypical way. Therefore in this paper, we define a novel metric to quantify the level of creativity involved in a player's passes. Our Creative Decision Rating (CDR) utilizes machine learning techniques to assess two important factors: the originality of a pass, and its value in terms of increasing the team's chances of scoring a goal. We validated our metric on StatsBomb 360 contextual event stream data of the 2021/22 English Premier League season and show through a number of use cases that it provides another angle on a player's skill, complementing existing player evaluation metrics. Overall, our metric provides a concise method for capturing and quantifying the creativity of soccer players and could have important implications for player recruitment and talent development in the sport. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:54:04","","4768 - 4777","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 10; All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 10; All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and women's singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players' tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:59","","5126 - 5136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 8</p>; <p>Cited by: 8</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As this problem has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing work on representing strategic relations among players’ shot types and movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion for Movement Forecasting model (DyMF) with interaction style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and between both players within a rally, and dynamic players’ tactics across time. In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods and demonstrate the practical usage of movement forecasting.

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However, converting the sensor information to 3-D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Toward solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), encoder-decoder networks, and ResNets to extract 3-D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3-D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. In addition, this article validates the feasibility of mirrored bilateral training approach with applications in prosthetic devices.

A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs, an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance.

In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, aiming to extract valuable insights from large volumes of cricket data. Cricket has many fans in India. With a strong fan following, many try to use their cricket intuition to predict the outcome of a match. A set of rules and a points system govern the game. The venue and the performance of each player greatly affect the outcome of the match. The game is difficult to predict accurately as the various components are closely related. The CRR (Current Run Rate) approach is used to predict the final score of the first innings of a cricket match. Total points are calculated by multiplying the average number of runs scored in each over by the total number of overs. For ODI cricket, these methods are useless as the game can change very quickly regardless of the current run rate. The game may be decided by 1 or 2 overs. For more accurate score predictions, a system is needed that can more accurately predict the outcome of an inning. This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict scores and classify players based on their roles in the squad. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of cricket matches, including player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest regression models are employed to predict scores. Additionally, player categorization is performed using a classification approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in enhancing performance analysis and decision-making in the game of cricket. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:54:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 13</p>; <p>Cited by: 13</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a machine learning-based (ML) strategy for forecasting football match results is presented. In the past, the number of goals scored by each team in a football (FB) game served as a benchmark for assessing a team's performance and projecting future outcomes to forecast the results of football games, such as win, draw, or defeat. However, there are significant discrepancies between a team's performance and the number of goals scored or conceded throughout many games because the number of goals scored during a match contains a significant random element.The goal of this study is to create an accurate and dependable prediction model that will help fans, analysts, and bet enthusiasts make wise selections. The selection of features, treatment of data that is imbalanced and the generalization of models constitute significant issues that are addressed in this paper. The system learns patterns from previous encounters and player attributes to develop predictions for upcoming games.

To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters, it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the 2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:50:42","2025-09-29 14:53:26","","","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a universal JErsey number DEtector (JEDE) for player identification is presented that predicts players' bounding boxes and keypoints, along with bounding boxes and classes of jersey digits and numbers in an end-to-end manner. Instead of generating digit proposals from pre-defined anchors, JEDE predicts more robust proposals guided by players' features and pose estimation. Moreover, a dataset is collected from soccer and basketball matches with annotations on players' bounding boxes and body keypoints, and jersey digits' bounding boxes and labels.

However, applying deep learning techniques to sports analytics has several technical challenges, which also remain untouched in badminton analytics as there is no public dataset of stroke event records. Therefore, this dissertation intends to explore challenging research questions and application issues that have not been addressed for benefiting both the research and badminton communities. To achieve the objectives, we, for the first time, propose a unified badminton language to describe the process of the shot, which enables us to conduct downstream applications. Specifically, our first task is to measure the win probability of each shot in badminton matches by considering long-term and short-term dependencies. Second, we introduce a framework with two encoder-decoder extractors and a position-aware fusion network to forecast the possible tactics of players, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. To provide the transparency of these models, we aim to design a post-hoc explainer by computing feature attributions with Shapley values as the third task. In this manner, researchers can investigate model behaviors for advanced improvement, and the badminton community benefits from coaching the players and determining the strategies.

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction.

Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility.

With cricket being a very dynamic game, bettors and bookies are incentivised to bet on the match results because it is a game that changes ball-by-ball. This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:59","","256 - 266","","3-4","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 48; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 48; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tasks generally involve object detection and tracking operations that require pre-processing the video through expensive machine learning models. To address this cost, several video query optimizers have recently been proposed. Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies. We compare OTIF against three recent video query optimizers, as well as several general-purpose object detection and tracking techniques, and find that, across multiple datasets, OTIF provides a 6x to 25x average reduction in the overall cost to execute five queries over the same video. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:51","","2091 - 2104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 18; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 18; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model is made out of statistical information from reputable sports sources and websites on the best ODI players for the Indian national cricket team. The performance of the players depends on various factors such as the opposition team, the venue, and the number of balls faced by the batsman. This paper makes an attempt to forecast the performance of batsmen based on several features. The main motive behind this study is to predict batsmen performance based on available data using different Regression models like Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DT), Random Forest (RF) Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and evaluate which model is best for the prediction of different batsmen performance.

Unfortunately, how to evaluate the use of machine learning in the context of sports remains extremely challenging. On the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the developed indicators themselves, where one is confronted by a lack of labels and small sample sizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate the models themselves, which is complicated by the noisy and non-stationary nature of sports data.

As most experts will agree, not all passes are of equal difficulty, however, most traditional metrics count them as such. With our work we can quantify how well players can execute passes, assess their risk profile, and even compute completion probabilities for hypothetical passes by combining physical and machine learning models. Our model uses the first 0.4 seconds of a ball trajectory and the movement vectors of all players to predict the intended target of a pass with an accuracy of 93.0 % for successful and 72.0 % for unsuccessful passes much higher than any previously published work. Our extreme gradient boosting model can then quantify the likelihood of a successful pass completion towards the identified target with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.4 %.

"WGJMSBCV","journalArticle","2021","Das, Muralee; Myrden, Susan E.","America’s major league soccer: artificial intelligence and the quest to become a world class league","CASE Journal","","","10.1108/TCJ-10-2020-0140","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117343676&doi=10.1108%2FTCJ-10-2020-0140&partnerID=40&md5=6d4317977c95ec630939016f1a14db62","Theoretical basis: Resource-based view (RBV) theory (Barney, 1991; Barney and Mackey, 2016; Nagano, 2020) states that a firm’s tangible and intangible resources can represent a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), a long-term competitive advantage that is extremely difficult to duplicate by another firm, when it meets four criteria (i.e. not imitable, are rare, valuable and not substitutable). In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies…. and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology: This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis: MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation. Complexity academic level: The case is written and designed for a graduate-level (MBA) class or an upper-level undergraduate class in areas such as contemporary issues in management, human resource management, talent management, strategic management, sports management and sports marketing. The case is suitable for courses that discuss strategy, talent management, human resource management and brand strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:09","","202 - 225","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 2</p>; <p>Cited by: 2</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:52:34","","39 - 45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 5</p>; <p>Cited by: 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24Â° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33Â° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user.

Towards addressing this problem, this paper presents ZeroNet, a system that shows the feasibility of developing ML models for IMU sensors with zero training overhead. ZeroNet harvests training data from publicly available videos for performing inferences on IMU. The difference in data among video and IMU domains introduces a number of challenges due to differences in sensor-camera coordinate systems, body sizes of users, speed/orientation changes during gesturing, sensor position variations etc. ZeroNet addresses these challenges by systematically extracting motion data from videos and transforming them into acceleration and orientation information measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, data-augmentation techniques are exploited that create synthetic variations in the harvested training data to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the ML models to user diversity. Evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 82.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 94.8% for recognition of 50 finger gestures thus indicating promise.

The most significant challenges in machine learning include class imbalance and high dimensionality problems. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and observed that both the issues have been studied independently. We found that feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of relevant features, while data sampling seeks to make the data more balanced by adding or removing instances. We also found out that efforts have been taken for studying the effect of the joint use of feature selection and balancing techniques. However, the prioritization of the feature selection and sampling is still difficult, and the relationship between them remains unclear. This paper presents a large-scale comparison of characterizing football players into nine positions by using FIFA video game data, whereas most of the previous studies in this field have focused on characterizing players into only three classes according to their positions. The proposed methodology for the study consists of three main steps. In the first step, the sampling technique is applied to deal with class imbalance, while the second step encompasses the feature selection technique, which deals with the high dimensionality problem. The third step combines feature selection and data sampling to deal with both the issues. We made the comparisons based on nine feature selection algorithms and three balancing techniques, and then we evaluated their performance using the random forest classifier. We found that 1) feature selection techniques did not improve the accuracy of the baseline model, 2) balancing techniques improved the accuracy compared to the baseline, and 3) the results showed superiority of the proposed methodology, involving the joint application of resampling and feature selection with data balanced by the random oversampling (ROS) method and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), compared to the results obtained only through the use of a single technique and from the original imbalanced training set. Overall, the proposed methodology improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the methodology provided a significant decrease in the number of features, from 29 to 10 features on average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:30","","149266 - 149286","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 31; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <p>Cited by: 31; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To justify the comparative accuracy and define the best predictive analytics, the well-known random forest, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost model have been considered. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been considered as the benchmark for further comparison with all features. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the XGBoost Classifier integrated with the wrapper methods offers precise prediction results for cardiovascular disease. The proposed approach can also be applied in other domains such as sports analytics, bio-informatics, and financial analysis in contrast with healthcare informatics. This empirical study’s novelty is that the common “True” condition–based feature selection and comparison technique is entirely a new phenomenon in medical informatics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:25","","49 - 62","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 55</p>; <p>Cited by: 55</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of ""SportsEd 3.5""for universities and collegiate athletic associations to develop an athlete information system for sports analytics. In addition, the framework aims to define the philosophy that will govern all the stakeholders in the utilization of an athlete's information for flexible decision-making. Players' dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports.

The major goal in sport analytics applications is to make informed decisions to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse and predict lineup performance in basketball which may assist the team managers and coaches to make informed decisions. The constant lineup change in basketball games makes it vital to always have the best move ready at every moment of the game. A complex decision-making system is very important for the coaches to navigate their team through a season. This system must make the decisions based on the pros and cons of the teams, past results and lineups, and both teams’ performance under similar situations. To create this system, authors have constructed a signed, directed, and weighted network from the results of all matchups and lineups of the teams in NBA from 2007 to 2019. The proposed approach uses machine learning and graph theory to develop a new metric called Inverse Square Metric and edge-centric multi-view networks to predict the performance of a lineup in a given situation. The edge-centric approach provides a deep analysis of any condition between two teams from 16 different perspectives. The average accuracy achieved by ISM and edge-centric multi-view is 68% and 80%, respectively. In the end, the training and test datasets are chosen from different seasons and results are reasonable compared to the baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:23","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 10</p>; <p>Cited by: 10</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, they are treated separately and studied by two independent communities. However, this is not the intuitive way how humans interpret the matches: we predict the match results with the competition carrying on, and simultaneously evaluate each action based on the game context and its downstream impact. Predicting the match outcomes and evaluating the actions are coupled tasks, and the more accurately we predict, the better the evaluation is To this end, we develop a unified Match Tracing framework (namely, MT), for tackling the win prediction and performance evaluation jointly. The main idea of MT is to learn a real-time look-ahead win rate curve rather than a single scalar (win or lose). And the value of an action can be objectively measured with respect to the increase or decrease of the curve. To meet the low-latency restrictions of the online deployments, an efficient model equipped with recurrent attention mechanism and matrix perturbation (i.e., MT-Net) is built for learning and yielding the win rate curve. MT-Net encodes the players' behavior sequence through an attention mechanism and captures the player-interaction effects through a graph embedding method. With the action values derived from the win rate curve, performance can be quantified at different granularities (action/player/match level) by integrated analysis. Experiments on an e-sport game demonstrate the prediction effectiveness and the feasibility of the MT framework. Furthermore, we present the detailed application cases of MT, including key actions recognition and close match detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:50:43","2025-09-29 14:53:44","","2781 - 2788","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 8</p>; <p>Cited by: 8</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adding the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions.

This paper focuses on data-driven defensive strategy learning in basketball. Most research to date on basketball strategylearning has focused on offensive effectiveness and is based on the interaction between the on-ball player and principleon-ball defender, thereby ignoring the contribution of the remaining players. Furthermore, most sports analytical systems that provide play-by-play data is heavily biased towards offensive metrics such as passes, dribbles, and shots. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning to classify the different defensive strategies basketball players adopt when deviating from their initial defensive action. An analytical model was developed to recognise the one-on-one (matched) relationships of the players, which is utilised to automatically identify any change of defensive strategy. A classification model is developed based on a player and ball tracking dataset from National Basketball Association (NBA) game play to classify the adopted defensive strategy against pick-and-roll play. The methodology described is the first toanalyse the defensive strategy of all in-game players (both on-ball players and off-ball players). The cross-validation results indicate that the proposed technique for automatic defensive strategy identification can achieve up to 69% accuracy of classification.

Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for studies published between 2018 and 2024. The PICO framework guided selection, and methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2.ResultsA total of 40 studies were included. CNNs (n = 18; accuracy = 96 +/- 1.5%) and LSTMs (n = 10; 92 +/- 2%) performed best for motion tracking and gait analysis. SVMs (n = 17; 81 +/- 3%) and RFs (n = 16; 80 +/- 2.8%) were widely used in EMG, GPS, and workload analysis. Real-time feedback (n = 18) showed latency below 100 ms but was mainly validated in controlled settings; only 25% tested systems outdoors. Wearable sensors (e.g., IMUs, gyroscopes) were used in 34 studies, most frequently on the lower limbs. Participants averaged 42 +/- 28 in number, with a bias toward young, healthy males. Key limitations included algorithm opacity, small homogeneous samples, inconsistent sensor setups, and limited interpretability or clinical integration.ConclusionAI/ML tools show high accuracy and responsiveness for biomechanical monitoring, injury risk detection, and training adaptation. However, scalability remains hindered by technical, demographic, and practical barriers. Future studies must prioritize diverse populations, standardize sensor and data protocols, emphasize model explainability, and ensure deployment in real-world sports environments to close the gap between algorithmic performance and applied utility.Trial registrationCRD42021235527","2025-07-02","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The review addresses key research questions, including primary AI methods, their effectiveness in improving athletic performance, their potential for injury prediction, sport-specific applications, strategies for translating knowledge, ethical considerations, and remaining research gaps. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across five databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus), encompassing studies published between January 2015 and December 2024. After screening 3248 articles, 73 studies met the inclusion criteria (Cohen's kappa = 0.84). Data were collected on AI techniques, biomechanical parameters, performance metrics, and implementation details. Results revealed a shift from traditional statistical models to advanced machine learning methods. Based on moderate-quality evidence from 12 studies, convolutional neural networks reached 94% agreement with international experts in technique assessment. Computer vision demonstrated accuracy within 15 mm compared to marker-based systems (6 studies, moderate quality). AI-driven training plans showed 25% accuracy improvements (4 studies, limited evidence). Random forest models predicted hamstring injuries with 85% accuracy (3 studies, moderate quality). Learning management systems enhanced knowledge transfer, raising coaches' understanding by 45% and athlete adherence by 3.4 times. Implementing integrated AI systems resulted in a 23% reduction in reinjury rates. However, significant challenges remain, including standardizing data, improving model interpretability, validating models in real-world settings, and integrating them into coaching routines. In summary, incorporating AI into sports biomechanics marks a groundbreaking advancement, providing analytical capabilities that surpass traditional techniques. Future research should focus on creating explainable AI, applying rigorous validation methods, handling data ethically, and ensuring equitable access to promote the widespread and responsible use of AI across all levels of competitive sports.","2025-08-20","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning enables the analysis of large volumes of data to establish complex relationships between “input” and “output” variables. These relationships may be more complex than could be established through traditional statistical analysis and can lead to the ability to predict the “output” with high levels of accuracy. Supervised learning is the most common ML approach for healthcare data and recent studies have developed algorithms to predict patient-specific outcome after surgical procedures such as hip arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Deep learning is a higher-level ML approach that facilitates the processing and interpretation of complex datasets through artificial neural networks that are inspired by the way the human brain processes information. In orthopaedic sports medicine, deep learning has primarily been used for automatic image (computer vision) and text (natural language processing) interpretation. While applications in orthopaedic sports medicine have been increasing exponentially, one significant barrier to widespread adoption of ML remains clinician unfamiliarity with the associated methods and concepts. The goal of this review is to introduce these concepts, review current machine learning models in orthopaedic sport medicine, and discuss future opportunities for innovation within the specialty.","2024-08","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","635-644","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current state of the research field, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far.

Existing methodologies have been frustratingly slow at developing higher precision prevention practices. Technological advancements have permitted the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) as promising toolsets to enhance both injury mitigation and rehabilitation protocols. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in ML techniques as they have been applied to sports injury prediction and prevention. A comprehensive literature review was conducted searching PubMed/Medline, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)/Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), and ScienceDirect. Ovid Discovery and Google Scholar were used to provide additional aggregate results and a grey literature search. A focus was placed on papers published from 2017 to 2022. Algorithms of interest were limited to K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-means, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting and AdaBoost, and neural networks. A total of 42 original research papers were included, and their results were summarized. We conclude that given the current lack of open source, uniform data sets, as well as a reliance on dated regression models, no strong conclusions about the real world efficacy of ML as it applies to sports injury prediction can be made. However, it is suggested that addressing these two issues will allow powerful, novel ML architectures to be deployed, thus rapidly advancing the state of this field, and providing validated clinical tools.","2023-09-28","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increasing sophistication of AI has created new opportunities to apply these algorithms within within trauma care. Our paper overviews the current uses of AI along the continuum of trauma care, including injury prediction, triage, emergency department volume, assessment, and outcomes. Starting at the point of injury, algorithms are being used to predict severity of motor vehicle crashes, which can help inform emergency responses. Once on the scene, AI can be used to help emergency services triage patients remotely in order to inform transfer location and urgency. For the receiving hospital, these tools can be used to predict trauma volumes in the emergency department to help allocate appropriate staffing. After patient arrival to hospital, these algorithms not only can help to predict injury severity, which can inform decision-making, but also predict patient outcomes to help trauma teams anticipate patient trajectory. Overall, these tools have the capability to transform trauma care. AI is still nascent within the trauma surgery sphere, but this body of the literature shows that this technology has vast potential. AI-based predictive tools in trauma need to be explored further through prospective trials and clinical validation of algorithms.","2023-03-06","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction model quality needs to be evaluated so clinicians can be informed of their potential usefulness. Objective To evaluate the methodological conduct and completeness of reporting of musculoskeletal injury prediction models in sport. Methods A systematic review was performed from inception to June 2021. Studies were included if they: (1) predicted sport injury; (2) used regression, machine learning, or deep learning models; (3) were written in English; (4) were peer reviewed. Results Thirty studies (204 models) were included; 60% of studies utilized only regression methods, 13% only machine learning, and 27% both regression and machine learning approaches. All studies developed a prediction model and no studies externally validated a prediction model. Two percent of models (7% of studies) were low risk of bias and 98% of models (93% of studies) were high or unclear risk of bias. Three studies (10%) performed an a priori sample size calculation; 14 (47%) performed internal validation. Nineteen studies (63%) reported discrimination and two (7%) reported calibration. Four studies (13%) reported model equations for statistical predictions and no machine learning studies reported code or hyperparameters. Conclusion Existing sport musculoskeletal injury prediction models were poorly developed and have a high risk of bias. No models could be recommended for use in practice. The majority of models were developed with small sample sizes, had inadequate assessment of model performance, and were poorly reported. To create clinically useful sports musculoskeletal injury prediction models, considerable improvements in methodology and reporting are urgently required.","2022-10","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","2469-2482","","10","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being recognized for its potential to transform AKI care by enabling early prediction, detection, and facilitating an individualized approach to patient management. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of externally validated ML models for the prediction, detection, and management of AKI. We systematically searched for relevant literature from inception to 15 February 2024, using four databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus. We focused solely on models that had undergone external validation, employed Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions for AKI, and utilized ML models (excluding logistic regression models). A total of 44 studies encompassing 161 ML models for AKI prediction, severity assessment, and outcomes in both adult and pediatric populations were included in the review. These studies encompassed 4,153,424 patient admissions, with 1,209,659 in the development and internal validation cohorts and 2,943,765 in the external validation cohorts. The ML models demonstrated significant variability in performance owing to differing clinical settings, populations, and predictors used. Most of the included models were developed in specialized patient populations, such as those in intensive care units, post-surgical settings, and specific disease states (e.g. congestive heart failure, traumatic brain injury, etc.). Moreover, only a few models incorporated dynamic predictors of AKI which are crucial for improving clinical utility in rapidly evolving clinical conditions like AKI. The variable performance of these models when applied to external validation cohorts highlights the challenges of reproducibility and generalizability in implementing ML models in AKI care. Despite acceptable performance metrics, none of the models assessed in this review underwent validation or implementation in real-world clinical workflows. These findings underscore the need for standardized performance metrics and validation protocols to enhance the generalizability and clinical applicability of these models. Future efforts should focus on enhancing model adaptability by incorporating dynamic predictors and unstructured data and by ensuring that models are developed in diverse patient populations. Moreover, collaboration between clinicians and data scientists is critical to ensure the development of models that are clinically relevant, fair, and tailored to real-world healthcare environments.","2025-08-18","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","454-476","","6","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review analyzes the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and the Y-Balance Test (YBT) landscape. Although these instruments are widely used because of their simplicity and ease of access, their accuracy in predicting injuries is inconsistent. Significant issues include reliance on broad scoring systems, varying contextual relevance, and neglecting individual characteristics such as age, gender, fitness levels, and past injuries. Meta-analyses reveal that the FMS and YBT overall scores often lack clinical relevance, exhibiting significant variability in sensitivity and specificity among different groups. Findings support the effectiveness of multifactorial models that consider modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as workload ratios, injury history, and fitness data for better prediction outcomes. Advances in machine learning (ML) and wearable technology, including inertial measurement units (IMUs) and intelligent monitoring systems, show promise by capturing dynamic and personalized high-dimensional data. Such approaches enhance our understanding of how biomechanical, physiological, and contextual injury aspects interact. This review discusses the problems of conventional movement screens, highlights the necessity for workload monitoring and personalized evaluations, and promotes the integration of technology-driven and data-centered techniques. Adopting tailored, multifactorial models could significantly improve injury prediction and prevention across varied populations. Future research should refine these models to enhance their practical use in clinical and field environments.","2025-02","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional metrics such as batting averages, runs scored, and wickets taken often fail to capture a player's comprehensive contribution to the game. Recent approaches, however, employ advanced statistical techniques including Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Generalized Geometric Distributions (GGD), Bayesian methods, copula functions, and machine learning algorithms, to develop novel performance indices. These methods incorporate contextual factors like opposition quality, pitch conditions, and match situations, offering a better evaluation, particularly in fast-paced formats like T20 cricket. The review emphasizes the integration of metrics across all skill areas to achieve an overall assessment, highlighting the significance of opening partnerships, high-pressure bowling performances, and fielding efficiency in determining match outcomes. It also discusses the growing utilization of real-time data and sophisticated analytics in strategic decision-making and player selection. However, challenges remain such as the difficulty in collecting detailed performance data, particularly for fielding actions, and considering psychological factors like how different players handle pressure. The review concludes by underscoring the need for future research to improve evaluation methods, include more detailed data, and integrate psychological dimensions. As cricket analytics continue to evolve, embracing these new approaches will help teams make better use of data, leading to improved strategies, player performance, and a deeper understanding of the game.","2025-06","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","1307-1319","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Liver injury is one of the most extensively studied endpoints due to its severity and frequency, occurring among populations that consume drugs or dietary supplements. In this review, we focus on recent developments of in silico modeling for liver injury prediction using deep learning and in vitro data based on adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Despite these models being mainly developed using datasets generated from drug-like molecules, they were also applied to the prediction of hepatotoxicity caused by herbal products. As deep learning has achieved great success in many different fields, advanced machine learning algorithms have been actively applied to improve the accuracy of in silico models. Additionally, the development of liver AOPs, combined with big data in toxicology, has been valuable in developing in silico models with enhanced predictive performance and interpretability. Specifically, one approach involves developing structure-based models for predicting molecular initiating events of liver AOPs, while others use in vitro data with structure information as model inputs for making predictions. Even though liver injury remains a difficult endpoint to predict, advancements in machine learning algorithms and the expansion of in vitro databases with relevant biological knowledge have made a huge impact on improving in silico modeling for drug-induced liver injury prediction.","2023-09","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:53:38","","","","","179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited by: 11; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic review of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed using specific search terms selected according to the PRISMA guidelines. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. The most commonly employed data component for data pre-processing was body composition data (most commonly, body mass and height), followed by player profile (most commonly, age followed by position). The most common machine learning technique for data processing was the decision tree, followed by logistic regression. The median AUC of the best performing models indicated per study was 0.75 (0.16), median sensitivity/recall was 0.78 (0.15), median specificity was 0.81 (0.27), and median precision was 0.53 (0.13). The performance of prediction models in the literature has been poor, caused by a fundamental difficulty in discovering real effects in small sample sizes with low injury rates. A better understanding of how training and game exposure is associated with the data components for data pre-processing and ultimately associated with injury is vital for the future development of robust injury prediction models.","2020-11","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","505-517","","6","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The measurement of CBT has been shown to predict heat-related illness and its severity, but the current measurement methods are not practical for use in high acuity and high motion settings due to their invasive and obstructive nature or excessive costs. Noninvasive predictions of CBT using wearable technology and predictive algorithms offer the potential for continuous CBT monitoring and early intervention to prevent HRI in athletic, military, and intense work environments. Thus far, there has been a lack of peer-reviewed literature assessing the efficacy of wearable devices and predictive analytics to predict CBT to mitigate heat-related illness. This systematic review identified 20 studies representing a total of 25 distinct algorithms to predict the core body temperature using wearable technology. While a high accuracy in prediction was noted, with 17 out of 18 algorithms meeting the clinical validity standards. few algorithms incorporated individual and environmental data into their core body temperature prediction algorithms, despite the known impact of individual health and situational and environmental factors on CBT. Robust machine learning methods offer the ability to develop more accurate, reliable, and personalized CBT prediction algorithms using wearable devices by including additional data on user characteristics, workout intensity, and the surrounding environment. The integration and interoperability of CBT prediction algorithms with existing heat-related illness prevention and treatment tools, including heat indices such as the WBGT, athlete management systems, and electronic medical records, will further prevent HRI and increase the availability and speed of data access during critical heat events, improving the clinical decision-making process for athletic trainers and physicians, sports scientists, employers, and military officers.","2022-10","2025-09-29 14:51:01","2025-09-29 14:51:01","","","","19","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, early recognition and prediction of ARDS are crucial for the timely administration of targeted treatment. However, ARDS is frequently underdiagnosed or delayed, and its heterogeneity diminishes the clinical utility of ARDS biomarkers. This study aimed to observe the incidence of ARDS among high-risk patients and develop and validate an ARDS prediction model using machine learning (ML) techniques based on clinical parameters. Methods: This prospective cohort study in China was conducted on critically ill patients to derivate and validate the prediction model. The derivation cohort, consisting of 400 patients admitted to the ICU of the Peking University Third Hospital(PUTH) between December 2020 and August 2023, was separated for training and internal validation, and an external data set of 160 patients at the FU YANG People's Hospital from August 2022 to August 2023 was employed for external validation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen predictor variables. Multiple ML classification models were integrated to analyze and identify the best models. Several evaluation indexes were used to compare the model performance, including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive ex Planations (SHAP) is used to interpret ML models. Results: 400 critically ill patients were included in the analysis, with 117 developing ARDS during follow-up. The final model included gender, Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS), Hepatic Disease, Shock, and combined Lung Contusion. Based on the AUC and DCA in the validation group, the logistic model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an AUC of 0.836 (95% CI: 0.762–0.910). For external validation, comprising 160 patients, 44 of whom developed ARDS, the AUC was 0.799 (95% CI: 0.723–0.875), significantly outperforming the LIPS score alone.

Baseball players are particularly susceptible to injuries, as players often compete in 5 to 7 games per week, placing continuous strain on their bodies. Among various injuries, Tommy John Surgery (TJS) poses a notable risk for Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. Traditional TJS prediction methods required sensors or video-based motion capture, which are impractical during actual games and limited in making predictions too close to the injuries, such as within 30 pitches. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that utilizes both classification and regression tasks. Using MLB pitching data (2016–2023), the classification model detects injury risk up to 100 days in advance with a high prediction performance of 0.73 F1-score, while the regression model estimates the time remaining until the player’s last pre-surgery game with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.79. In addition, to enhance our model’s applicability, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence technique to analyze the impacting mechanical features, such as a lowered four-seam fastball release point, that accelerate UCL deterioration, increasing TJS risk. These findings provide a practical foundation for early intervention strategies, potentially preserving pitcher health and reducing the need for complex surgical procedures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 2; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable predictive model employing machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately identify patients at high risk of acute liver injury within one month of initiating ICI treatment. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included pan-cancer patients who received their first ICI treatment between March 2019 and September 2022 at Zhongshan Hospital. Six ML algorithms, namely neural networks (NN), gradient boosting classifier (GBC), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), categorical boosting classifier (CatBoost) and random forest (RF), were utilized to construct predictive models for acute ICI-related liver injury. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and brier score (BS). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to rank the feature importance and interpret the final model, providing insights into the contribution of each feature to liver injury prediction, thereby enhancing clinical interpretability. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300067470). Results: A total of 863 patients were enrolled in the study, with 22.71% experiencing liver injury within one month of ICI initiation. Among the six preliminary models, the RF model exhibited the best performance and was selected for the development of the final model. The SHAP method was utilized to rank variables from the six pre-models, with 10 variables selected for the final model by identifying the intersection of the top 20 most important variables across these models. The final RF model exhibited robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73–0.90) on the test set, and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.88) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72–0.89) in the 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. The Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) curve illustrated solid clinical benefit, and the calibration curve reflected good predictive consistency. Conclusion: An interpretable RF model was developed to predict acute liver injury occurring within one month after ICI treatment. This clinical-friendly model enables early identification of high-risk patients, facilitating optimized clinical management and ultimately improving treatment outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","","","","203","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preventive approaches should consider all of these factors to help identify at-risk individuals. Advanced machine-learning tools and artificial intelligence can be utilized for this purpose. This study aimed to develop an effective injury prediction model for lower-limb sports injuries. Methods: A total of 120 male university-level football, cricket, and basketball players underwent elaborate mental and physical screening, accounting for 44 variables. The injury details of the previous season were recorded. Using these data, different injury-predicting muscle-learning models were built, and their efficiencies were compared. Results: Thirty-eight injuries were recorded, 20 (52.6 %) of which corresponded to ankle injuries, nine to hamstring injuries (23.6 %), four to knee injuries (10.5 %), and five to foot injuries (13.3 %). Eight injuries occurred during the training phase, and 30 injuries occurred during the competition. Six players sustained the injuries twice. In this case, only the initial injury was considered. Finally, thirty-two injuries were used to construct the model.

It shows great promise in areas such as injury prediction and athlete performance forecasting. This study explores the potential of using machine learning to predict archers' performance based solely on specific physiological parameters. Initially, the total success score of each archer was recorded after three sets of six shots, alongside measurements of their quiet eye parameters. The quiet eye represents the final fixation of the eye on a target, critical for task accuracy. Based on their scores, archers were categorized as low-potential athletes or high-potential athletes using an machine learning clustering method. Subsequently, machine learning classification algorithms were applied to predict the performance class of archers using only quiet eye parameters. The study involved 18 archers (equally split by sex) who had consistently trained in archery for at least two years. The results indicated that the performance classification of archers could be predicted with approximately 90% reliability using only quiet eye data. The findings suggest that machine learning based on quiet eye parameters offers a time-efficient alternative to traditional methods for identifying high-potential archers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Retrospective data from 1,304 cardiac surgery patients (1,028 AKI cases and 276 non-AKI controls) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. We analyzed three datasets: preoperative 48-hour averages, preoperative 48-hour maxima, and postoperative 24-hour maxima of critical physiological parameters. Using logistic regression, LASSO regression, and random forest (RF) algorithms, we constructed nine prediction models, evaluating their performance via AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, Youden’s index, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. Results Our findings demonstrate that all models achieved AUROC values >0.7, with three models exceeding 0.75. Notably, the logistic regression model incorporating preoperative 48-hour maximum values and postoperative 24-hour maximum values exhibited the highest predictive accuracy (AUROC = 0.755, 95%CI: 0.7185–0.7912), outperforming other configurations. This model’s superiority lies in its integration of dynamic preoperative and postoperative variables, capturing both baseline risks and acute postoperative changes.

Patients and Methods: We included adult patients (18 years or older) admitted to intensive care unit with at least stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI) at a tertiary medical center, using retrospective data collected between January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2022. The data were accessed and analyzed during the period from March 1st, 2023, through July 28th, 2023. The psAKI was defined as AKI stage 3 lasting for ≥72 hours or AKI leading to death in 48 hours or kidney replacement therapy in 1 day. The performance of the PersEA model, a boosted tree algorithm fed by hourly patient data via electronic health records to provide real-time psAKI predictions, was evaluated using specific metrics that penalize late alarms. We measured the area under the receiver operating characteristic and the area under the precision-recall curves. Results: After screening, 4479 patients from the Mayo Clinic cohort were included in the current external validation study, with 234 (5.22%) having psAKI. Results from the Amsterdam UMCdb (531 patients, 59 [11.11%] positive) and MIMIC-III (495 patients, 57 [11.52%] positive) cohorts were obtained in a prior development study. The model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.98) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.60-0.73), and when applying the threshold that reached 0.80 sensitivity on the internal cohort, PersEA achieved 0.88 sensitivity, 0.94 specificity, and 0.47 precision, all based on Mayo Clinic data.

Eight machine learning models-Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-were used for cross-valuation using eight different feature datasets; the occurrence of AKI serves as the outcome variable. The LightGBM model in conjunction with the XGBset dataset shows the best performance according to the outcomes. Incorporating 19 clinical characteristics, the LightGBM model was finally chosen to provide an early risk prediction model for AKI occurrences. With an AUC of 0.97 and an accuracy of 0.88 the model performed. Moreover, SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were proposed to improve the interpretability of the machine learning model, so increasing the transparency and clinical relevance of the prediction outcomes. Finally, this work shows that a predictive model with just 19 characteristics can still show good predictive accuracy, therefore offering vital support for individualized intervention and early AKI prediction.

Early prediction of DILI is crucial for developing safer pharmaceuticals, yet current in vitro and in vivo testing methods are complex and cumbersome. In this study, we developed an extreme gradient boosting (XGB)-powered machine learning (ML) model for DILI prediction. Comparing various DILI prediction models is challenging because they rely on different public data sets. We comprehensively evaluated the proposed BoostDILI model to address two crucial questions: 1. Can insights derived from public data sets help in DILI prediction for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs? 2. Can we generate structural alerts to improve the model’s explainability? To address the first question, we developed a DILI prediction model using four publicly available data sets. This effort led to the creation of the BoostDILI model, which achieved a 5-fold CV accuracy of 0.70. A sequential feature selection method was employed to identify relevant descriptors. This model integrates feature-level representations derived from RDKit (12 features) and Mordred (23 features) features. Bayesian statistics was applied to identify high-performance substructures iteratively, and a structural alerts model was developed to address the second question. The developed model was further validated with two FDA-approved drug data sets, DILIst and DILIRank. The BoostDILI model offers a trustable solution for evaluating the DILI risk in preclinical research. The structural alerts help in identifying the substructures that may be responsible for DILI.

However, factors influencing injury risk scores from a force plate system (SpartaScience™) and the effects of experimental perturbations on these scores remain unclear. Methods Healthy males (n = 823; 22.7 ± 3.9 yr) performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) on SpartaScience™ force plates. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of the system's proprietary Musculoskeletal (MSK) Health score, which were then experimentally perturbed. Twelve males (30.9 ± 4.3 yr) participated in a test-retest reliability study, performing three standard CMJs and one experimentally manipulated jump (50% effort) due to the observed relationship between the MSK Health score, vertical jump height, and body weight. Results The MSK Health score was negatively correlated with vertical jump height and positively with body weight (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, P < 0.001). Each inch increase in jump height decreased the MSK Health score by an average of 1.27 units (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.36), whereas each pound of body weight increased it by 0.12 units (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.13). Notably, 83% of participants in the reliability study improved their MSK Health score on the 50% effort jump. Conclusions The study revealed atypical relationships between MSK Health scores, vertical jump height, and body weight, with vertical jump height playing a majority role in predicting the principal output (MSK Health score). Findings indicated a higher injury risk with greater jump height but a lower risk with increased body weight. In addition, MSK Health scores paradoxically improved with lower effort (i.e., lower vertical jump height), which highlights the dangers of using undisclosed and unvetted algorithms for the prediction of health outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","710 - 715","","4","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Injury data (from March 2023 to Aug 2024) was collected from mechanised limestone mines in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, encompassing 446 workers' demographic details, health data and workplace conditions. The methodology involved exploratory data analysis, linear and non-linear regression models and advanced machine learning algorithms such as XG Boost, random forest, decision tree, and Bayesian ridge regression. risk factors namely skill level (semi-skilled), age (mean 43 years), experiences (mean 14 years), designation, qualifications, health status, work environment, and safety culture were analysed to predict injury occurrences. The results reveal that near misses and minor incidents are significant early indicators (T-value 1.35) of severe injuries, emphasising proactive safety measures. Among the models evaluated, XG Boost well performed with a training R-squared of 0.95 and test R-squared of 0.43, demonstrating its superior ability to generalise and capture complex relationships in the data. The analysis found that injuries are moderately common for contractual workers (mean: 0.90 per instance), with significant variability in near misses (mean: 8.05). Standardised working conditions, such as uniform duty hours (8 hrs.) and leave entitlements (30 days/year), contribute to the occurrence of injuries (t-value 1.35). Proactive measures to be taken in addressing factors like worker skill levels, availability of safety features and positive attitudes toward safety, are crucial for mitigating injuries at workplaces. Major Findings: From the study it can be concluded that the factors namely fire (T-value=5.64), experience (T-value=4.69), skill level (T-value=5.08), positive attitude towards safety (T-value=3.68), medical facilities (T-value=4.35), working conditions of the site (T-value=5.23) and available equipment with safety features (T-value=4.55) are the significant factors that contribute to the occurrence of the injuries among contractual workers in surface mines.

This requires an accurate and efficient prediction of the development of pressure injuries. We aimed to develop a method for estimating skin temperature changes due to ischemia and inflammation using temperature sensors placed under bedsheets to provide an objective, non-invasive, and non-constrained risk assessment tool. Methods: This study consisted of a thermal skin simulation study and a descriptive correlation study in healthy participants. A thermal skin simulation study was conducted using a model reproducing the body surface (underwear, diaper, or wet diaper conditions) and bed environment. In a descriptive-correlational study, the participants lay supine on a mattress with a temperature sensor attached to their sacral skin. Findings: The thermal skin simulation study showed that temperature changes in the skin can be estimated under the sheets by inputting time-shifted temperature data into machine learning (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9967 for underwear, 0.9950 for diapers, and 0.9869 for wet diapers). It was also demonstrated that the absolute skin temperature of a healthy individual (N = 17) could be estimated with the best accuracy by inputting time-shifted data into an extra-tree regressor (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8145). Interpretation: A combination of interface pressure and temperature sensors can be used to estimate skin temperature changes. These findings contribute to the development of a skin temperature measurement method that can capture temperature changes over time in clinical settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate interactions for athletes, coaches, and administrators, our planned ISMS integrates a user-friendly interface accessible through web and mobile applications. Besides, scheduling and event management are managed by the business logic layer. Similarly, the data management layer can process and store comprehensive data from various sources. To ensure smooth data exchange, the integration layer connects the ISMS with third-party services, and the analytics and AI layer leverages machine learning to provide actionable insights on performance and outcomes. In addition, the IoT layer collects real-time data from sensors and wearable devices, which is essential for performance analysis and injury prevention. Finally, the security layer ensures data integrity and confidentiality with robust encryption and access controls. To evaluate the system performance in different scenarios, we performed many experiments, which show that the proposed ISMS model shows the system efficacy in improving accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.97), recall (0.91), precision (0.93), F1 score (0.95), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.6), mean square error (MSE) (0.8), and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.9), compared to traditional methods. From these results, it is clear that our suggested approach improves athlete performance monitoring, injury prevention plans, and training schedules by presenting a complete and novel solution for recent sports management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:19","2025-09-29 14:51:19","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The sample consisted of 25 players from one of the 16 teams participating in the Persian Gulf Pro League during the 2022–2023 season. Player injury data and raw GPS data from all training and competition sessions throughout the football league season were gathered (214 training sessions and 34 competition sessions). The acute-tochronic workload ratio was calculated separately for each variable using a ratio of 1:3 weeks. Finally, the decision tree algorithm with machine learning was utilised to assess the predictive power of injury occurrence based on the acute-to-chronic workload ratio.

Methods: Player match performance data were captured by Stats Perform for every National Rugby League season from 2018 until 2022; a total of five seasons. The dataset was divided into offensive and defensive variables and further split according to player position. Five machine learning algorithms (Principal Component Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Regression Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boost) were considered in the analysis, which ultimately generated Wins Created and Losses Created for offensive and defensive performance, respectively. These two metrics were combined to create a final metric of Net Wins Added. The validity of these player performance metrics against traditional objective and subjective measures of performance in rugby league were evaluated. Results: The metrics correctly predicted the winner of 80.9% of matches, as well as predicting the number of team wins per season with an RMSE of 1.9. The metrics displayed moderate agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.505) when predicting team of the year award recipients. When predicting State of Origin selection, the metrics displayed moderate agreement for New South Wales (0.450) and substantial agreement for Queensland (0.652).

In this work, we collect hand and arm inertial data of basketball shots and perform deep analysis to determine key factors that contribute to three main questions: the shot outcomes, the position of shots, and the experience level of players. We also investigate how well machine learning-based models can answer these three questions. To do this, we engineered statistical-based features from the shot inertial data. Then, we trained and evaluated the performance of five machine learning models. The results show that the experience level of the player can be accurately determined from the inertial data by both an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector classifier (SVC). An extreme gradient boosted (XGBoost) model had the best success classifying the location from which the shot was taken with an accuracy of 94%. Finally, SVC predicted the outcome of the shot as either a miss or a basket, with an accuracy of 76%. Further analysis revealed that the arm and hand accelerations and rotation in the y-axis are critical factors in basketball shooting.

Prior research has shown that individuals with NSSI exhibit abnormal pain perception; however, the pain-processing neural circuits underlying NSSI remain poorly understood. This study leverages graph neural networks to predict NSSI risk and examine the learned connectivity of neural underpinnings using multimodal data. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were collected from 50 patients with NSSI, 79 healthy controls (HC), and 44 patients with mental disorder who did not engage in NSSI as disease controls (DC). We constructed pain-related brain networks for each participant. An interpretable graph attention networks (GAT) model was developed, considering demographic factors, to predict NSSI risk and highlight NSSI-specific connectivity using learned attention matrices. Results: The proposed GAT model based on imaging data achieved an accuracy of 80%, and increased to 88% when self-reported pain scales were incorporated alongside imaging data in distinguishing patients with NSSI from HC. It highlighted amygdala-parahippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-insula connectivity as pivotal in NSSI-related pain processing. After incorporating imaging data of DC, the model’s accuracy reached 74%, underscoring consistent neural connectivity patterns. The GAT model demonstrates high predictive accuracy for NSSI, enhanced by including self-reported pain scales. Conclusions: Our proposed GAT model underscores the significance in the functional integration of limbic regions, paralimbic regions and IFG in NSSI pain processing. Our findings suggest altered pain processing as a key mechanism in NSSI, providing insights for potential neural modulation intervention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","","","1","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we suggest the use of the MLP-LSTM model to forecast athletic injuries and prescribe individualized workout schedules relevant to the specific athlete. Multilayer perceptron and long short-term memory network are used together for designing MLP-LSTM architecture that has the capacity to grasp temporal patterns present in athlete information and predict injuries. It will employ training data, athletes' profile, and data on their past and present injuries and using statistical and mathematical models to read into it and look for signs that may be precursors to possible injuries. Accordingly, individual training schedules are suggested with the intent to minimize the chances for sustaining an injury while at the same time maximize performance. The creation of this system appears to be fundamentally proactive with regards to athletic training because it puts it in the hands of the coaches and athletes involved to allow prevention of injuries when they are most likely to occur. Based on the experimental results, it can be concluded that MLP-LSTM outperforms most of the traditional machine learning classifiers for the injury prediction. Moreover, the workout routines created by the system have proved to enhance the athletes' performance and prevent injuries.

Consequently, injury prediction and prevention are also increasingly addressed from a statistical perspective. In a pilot study, several machine learning algorithms and conventional statistical approaches have been compared regarding their potential to predict time-loss non-contact lower-body injuries in professional youth soccer players, using data from a prospective cohort study with 56 players of which 22 were injured. The covariates considered here include basic soccer-related as well as neuromuscular and biomechanical features derived from physical testing. Lasso regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines are considered for binary classification and prediction of an injury occurrence. The prediction results from a cross-validated procedure are compared regarding multiple quality measures. Post Lasso logistic regression with a reduced penalty gives the best results with an accuracy of 0.625, a predictive likelihood of 0.593, and a Brier score of 0.228. The respective sensitivity and specificity are 0.773 and 0.529, with an AUC of 0.672. Moreover, an XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Lasso model in terms of accuracy (0.661), while for the other performance measures it is dominated by the Lasso. In addition to the specific results on the available injury data set, the proposed comparison procedure of several models for binary prediction provides a generally applicable analysis guideline. This roadmap can also be applied in other contexts where similarly structured small but rich data sets are available. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","133 - 164","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study analyzed clinical features using machine learning techniques to provide precise and individualized injury risk assessment and prediction. We recruited 98 baseball players and collected data on glenohumeral internal/external rotation, posterior capsule thickness, supraspinatus tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance, and occupation ratio. Players were monitored for upper extremity injuries throughout a baseball season. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of these clinical variables using five models: Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and Support Vector Machine. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis was used to clarify each feature’s role in injury prediction. During the season, 28 players experienced injuries. CatBoost (accuracy: 0.70 ± 0.05; AUC: 0.66 ± 0.05) and logistic regression (accuracy: 0.63 ± 0.07; AUC: 0.64 ± 0.08) excelled in bootstrapped evaluations and performed well in independent tests, with CatBoost maintaining an accuracy of 0.70 and an AUC of 0.62. Including GIRD had a negligible effect on CatBoost’s accuracy. This integration with SHAP analyses enables a better understanding of each clinical feature’s role in predicting injuries, laying the foundation for personalized injury prevention strategies.

The aim of this study is to calculate the risk of presenting musculoskeletal injuries in surgeons after surgical practice. Methods: Cross-sectional study carried out using an online form (12/2021–03/2022) aimed at members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons. Demographic variables on physical and professional activity were recorded, as well as musculoskeletal pain (MSP) associated with surgical activity. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to identify risk factors associated with the development of MSP based on personalized surgical activity. To achieve this, a risk algorithm was computed and an online machine learning calculator was created to predict them. Physiotherapeutic recommendations were generated to address and alleviate each MSP. Results: A total of 651 surgeons (112 trainees, 539 specialists). 90.6% reported MSP related to surgical practice, 60% needed any therapeutic measure and 11.7% required a medical leave. In the long term, MSP was most common in the cervical and lumbar regions (52.4, 58.5%, respectively). Statistically significant risk factors (OR CI 95%) were for trunk pain, long interventions without breaks (3.02, 1.65–5.54). Obesity, indicated by BMI, to lumbar pain (4.36, 1.84–12.1), while an inappropriate laparoscopic screen location was associated with cervical and trunk pain (1.95, 1.28–2.98 and 2.16, 1.37–3.44, respectively). A predictive model and an online calculator were developed to assess MSP risk. Furthermore, a need for enhanced ergonomics training was identified by 89.6% of surgeons. Conclusions: The prevalence of MSP among surgeons is a prevalent but often overlooked health concern.

This method aims to enhance the protective effect of vehicle front-end for e-bike riders by encompassing a broader range of test scenarios. Initially, large-scale rider injury response data were collected using automated Madymo simulations. A machine learning model was then trained to accurately predict the risk of rider injury under varied crash conditions. Subsequently, this model was integrated into a multi-objective optimization framework, combined with multi-criteria decision analysis, to effectively evaluate and rank various design alternatives on the Pareto frontier. This process entailed a comparative analysis of the design in a baseline scenario before and after optimization, focusing on both kinematic and injury responses of riders. Through detailed injury mechanism analysis, key design variables such as the height of the hood front and the width of the bumper were identified. This led to the proposal of specific optimization strategies for these structural parameters. The results from this study demonstrate that the proposed optimization method not only guides the design process accurately and efficiently but also balances the injury risks across different body parts.

Advancements in artificial intelligence have opened new avenues for enhancing the decision-making process, empowering golfers to achieve optimal performance on the course. In this paper, we introduce an AI-based game planning system that assists players in selecting the best club for a given scenario. The system considers factors such as distance, terrain, wind strength and direction, and quality of lie. A rule-based model provides the four best club options based on the player’s maximum shot data for each club. The player picks a club, shot, and target and a probabilistic classification model identifies whether the shot represents a birdie opportunity, par zone, bogey zone, or worse. The results of our model show that taking into account factors such as terrain and atmospheric features increases the likelihood of a better shot outcome. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","","","9","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work aims to forecast and comparatively evaluate players’ goal-scoring likelihood in four elite football leagues (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Serie A) by mining advanced statistics from 2017 to 2023. Six types of machine learning (ML) models were developed and tested individually through experiments on the comprehensive datasets collected for these leagues. We also tested the upper 30th percentile of the best-performing players based on their performance in the last season, with varied features evaluated to enhance prediction accuracy in distinct scenarios. The results offer insights into the forecasting abilities of those leagues, identifying the best forecasting methodologies and the factors that most significantly contribute to the prediction of players’ goal-scoring. XGBoost consistently outperformed other models in most experiments, yielding the most accurate results and leading to a well-generalized model.

However, most available head injury models are ""average""models that employ a single set of head geometry (e.g., 50th-percentile U.S. male) without considering variability in these parameters across the human population. A significant variability of head shapes exists in U.S. Army soldiers, evident from the Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Army Personnel (ANSUR II). The objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of head shape on the predicted risk of traumatic brain injury from computational head injury models. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 25 human subjects are collected. These images are registered to the standard MNI152 brain atlas, and the resulting transformation matrix components (called head shape parameters) are used to quantify head shapes of the subjects. A generative machine learning model is used to generate 25 additional head shape parameter datasets to augment our database. Head injury models are developed for these head shapes, and a rapid injurious head rotation event is simulated to obtain several brain injury predictor variables (BIPVs): Peak cumulative maximum principal strain (CMPS), average CMPS, and the volume fraction of brain exceeding an injurious CMPS threshold. A Gaussian process regression model is trained between head shape parameters and BIPVs, which is then used to study the relative sensitivity of the various BIPVs on individual head shape parameters. We distinguish head shape parameters into 2 types: Scaling components,, and that capture the breadth, length, and height of the head, respectively, and shearing components (, and) that capture the relative skewness of the head shape. Results: An overall positive correlation is evident between scaling components and BIPVs. Notably, a very high, positive correlation is seen between the BIPVs and the head volume. As an example, a 57% increase in peak CMPS was noted between the smallest and the largest investigated head volume parameters. The variation in shearing components, and on average does not cause notable changes in the BIPVs. From the Gaussian process regression model, all 3 BIPVs showed an increasing trend with each of the 3 scaling components, but the BIPVs are found to be most sensitive to the height dimension of the head. From the Sobol sensitivity analysis, the scaling parameter contributes nearly 60% to the total variance in peak and average CMPS; contributes approximately 20%, whereas contributes less than 5%. The remaining contribution is from the 6 shearing components. Unlike peak and average CMPS, the VF-CMPS BIPV is associated with relatively evenly distributed Sobol indices across the 3 scaling parameters. Furthermore, the contribution of shearing components on the total variance in this case is negligible. Conclusions: Head shape has a considerable influence on the injury predictions of computational head injury models. Available ""average""head injury models based on a 50th-percentile U.S. male are likely associated with considerable uncertainty. In general, larger head sizes correspond to greater BIPV magnitudes, which point to potentially a greater injury risk under rapid neck rotation for people with larger heads. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","608 - 617","","Supplement_3","189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 3</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge of accurately predicting injuries presents an opportunity for researchers to develop prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence of such injuries. Consequently, this issue requires further investigation to obtain insights into effective mitigation strategies. In 120 male soccer players, the maximum isometric strength of the hip muscle groups was measured, and the strength ratios were calculated. Previous injury and anthropometric data were registered. Injury data were collected following the FIFA/UEFA consensus. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) was used to predict the incidence of injury, while the significant predictive variables of the k-NN algorithm were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model (LR) to analyze the likelihood of players sustaining a groin injury. The LR model determined two variables as significant predictors of groin injury. Players were less likely to sustain a groin injury by 76% for each decrease of the adductor/abductor isometric strength ratio in the non-dominant limb (OR = 0.238, CI 95% = [(0.098–0.572]).

Methods: This was a retrospective study of tertiary hospitals in Seoul, Korea. It analyzed patients in 12 departments where many pressure injuries occurred, including 8 general wards and 4 intensive care units from January 2018 to May 2022. In total, 182 variables were included in the model development. A pressure injury prediction model was developed using the gradient boosting algorithm, logistic regression, and decision tree methods, and it was compared to the Braden scale. Results: Among the 1, 389, 660 general ward cases, there were 451 cases of pressure injuries, and among 139, 897 intensive care unit cases, there were 297 cases of pressure injuries. Among the tested prediction models, the gradient boosting algorithm showed the highest predictive performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the gradient boosting algorithm’s pressure injury prediction model in the general ward and intensive care unit was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.83 0.89) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.79 0.87), respectively. This model was integrated into the electronic health record system to show each patient’s probability for pressure injury occurrence, and the risk factors calculated every hour. Conclusion: The prediction model developed using the gradient boosting algorithm exhibited higher performance than the Braden scale.

The data collected from 607 higher education students (mean age = 16.86; Std = 1.22), includes measurements from physical tests and activity records. The dataset comprises 29 variables, which were profiled and feature-engineered to enhance predictive accuracy for training procedures. We leveraged Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to determine the significance of features on outcomes and utilized Power BI to visualize the impact of aggregate features on running distance. Initial findings indicates that the optimal age range for focusing training efforts is between 16 and 17 years old. This result is supported by a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.42, stipulating a moderate positive relationship between the age group and the predicted performance outcomes based on key aggregate features. In particular, four key features significantly impact performance, while other variables have a minor influence. The study highlights the significance of these aggregate features in predicting training success. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of a robust reporting process and the use of predictive analysis in developing training programs. It identifies four critical features that have a substantial impact on realized performance. While these four features are paramount, the study also acknowledges that other variables, though less influential, may still affect the outcomes if considered. This comprehensive approach to data collection and analysis provides a solid foundation for optimizing athlete training programs, ensuring that training efforts are both targeted and effective. The findings offer valuable insights for coaches and sports scientists aiming to enhance athletic performance through data-driven training strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","1927 - 1932","","8","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Maybe</p> <p></p> </div>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, machine learning approaches have been developed to predict AKI ahead of time. However, the prevalence of AKI is often underestimated in state-of-the-art approaches, as they rely on an AKI event annotation solely based on creatinine, ignoring urine output. We construct and evaluate early warning systems for AKI in a multi-disciplinary ICU setting, using the complete KDIGO definition of AKI. We propose several variants of gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)-based models, including a novel time-stacking based approach. A state-of-the-art LSTM-based model previously proposed for AKI prediction is used as a comparison, which was not specifically evaluated in ICU settings yet. Results: We find that optimal performance is achieved by using GBDT with the time-based stacking technique (AUPRC 65.7%, compared with the LSTM-based model's AUPRC 62.6%), which is motivated by the high relevance of time since ICU admission for this task. Both models show mildly reduced performance in the limited training data setting, perform fairly across different subcohorts, and exhibit no issues in gender transfer. Following the official KDIGO definition substantially increases the number of annotated AKI events. In our study GBDTs outperform LSTM models for AKI prediction. Generally, we find that both model types are robust in a variety of challenging settings arising for ICU data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:20","2025-09-29 14:51:20","","i247 - i256","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 783-786, 2024 - Vertical countermovement jump (CMJ) assessments on force plates have been purported to screen for musculoskeletal injury risk (MSKI) but with little scientific support. Thus, this study aimed to identify associations and noncontact lower-body injury predictability with CMJ force-time metrics in female athletes. The study entailed a retrospective analysis of routine injury and performance monitoring from 155 female National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I athletes. Noncontact lower-body injuries included in analysis were confirmed by medical staff, occurred during competition or training, resulted in time loss from training, and occurred within 3 months following CMJ testing (2 maximal effort, no arm swing, jumps on dual force plates). A total of 44 injuries occurred within 3 months following CMJ baseline testing and resulted in an average of 24.5 missed days from training. Those who sustained an injury were more likely to sustain another injury (15 of 44 injuries [33.1%]; odds ratio = 3.05 [95% CI = 1.31-6.99]). For every 1-unit increase from the mean in eccentric mean power and minimum eccentric force, there was a decrease in odds of sustaining a MSKI. Despite high overall model accuracy (85.6%), the receiving operating characteristic area under the curve (65.9%) was unacceptable and the true positive rate (recall) was 0.0%. Thus, no injuries in the testing data set were correctly classified by the logistic regression model with CMJ force-time metrics as predictors. Baseline CMJ assessment may not be useful for noncontact lower-body musculoskeletal injury screening or predictability in National Collegiate Athletics Association female athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","783 - 786","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 4</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary care clinics largely rely on screening questionnaires to identify people at risk of falls. Limitations of standard fall risk screening questionnaires include suboptimal accuracy, missing data, and non-standard formats, which hinder early identification of risk and prevention of fall injury. We used machine learning methods to develop and evaluate electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to identify older adults at risk of fall-related injuries in a primary care population and compared this approach to standard fall screening questionnaires. Methods: Using patient-level clinical data from an integrated healthcare system consisting of 16-member institutions, we conducted a case–control study to develop and evaluate prediction models for fall-related injuries in older adults. Questionnaire-derived prediction with three questions from a commonly used fall risk screening tool was evaluated. We then developed four temporal machine learning models using routinely available longitudinal EHR data to predict the future risk of fall injury. We also developed a fall injury-prevention clinical decision support (CDS) implementation prototype to link preventative interventions to patient-specific fall injury risk factors. Results: Questionnaire-based risk screening achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) up to 0.59 with 23% to 33% similarity for each pair of three fall injury screening questions. EHR-based machine learning risk screening showed significantly improved performance (best AUROC = 0.76), with similar prediction performance between 6-month and one-year prediction models. Conclusions: The current method of questionnaire-based fall risk screening of older adults is suboptimal with redundant items, inadequate precision, and no linkage to prevention. A machine learning fall injury prediction method can accurately predict risk with superior sensitivity while freeing up clinical time for initiating personalized fall prevention interventions. The developed algorithm and data science pipeline can impact routine primary care fall prevention practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","1145 - 1154","","4","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 9</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model structure used two CNNs to aggregate robust and reliable features from video frames. The extracted features are then used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM), which have been pledged to complete the classification task. Throughout the model's development process, it turned out to be very accurate, as test results proved it. The precision lies between 86.38% and 96.61%, while recall scores are between 88.65% to 97.98%. The F1 scores vary between 89.01% and 95.97%.

The experimental results show that the average processing time of the proposed model is about 90 ms, and the output video frame rate is 10 frames per second, which can meet the real-time requirements. This study analysed the students participating in the basketball league of the College of Sports Science of Nantong University, and the results confirmed the accuracy of the injury prediction of college basketball players based on FMS scores. It is hoped that this study can provide some reference for the research of injury prevention of basketball players. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","346 - 355","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This allowed us to aggregate local data learning into a unified global model. This study indicates that the data, which is international and the utility of which is further improved by the inputs of clients from different locations, has achieved significant levels of recall, precision, and accuracy, respectively. Client bj-5 achieved outstanding levels of precision and recall, with both metrics reaching 88.86% and 89.07%, respectively. The precision-recall score reached 0.89, while the accuracy was 0.96. In contrast, bj-2 exhibited a minor delay, achieving precision and recall rates of 76.96% and 77.21%, respectively. In that respect, the system got an F1-Score of 77.01% and an accuracy of 91%. Additional macro, micro, and weighted averages examination highlighted the model's reliable performance across different serve shot motions. The highest value of the macro average (i.e., 77.06%) was observed in model bj-2, while the lowest was recorded in model bj-5 (i.e., only 83.35%). Micro averages of the model showed a more comprehensive range of model accuracy, which was only 76.99% in the model bj-2, and only the model's robustness was confirmed by observing weighted averages ranging from 76.94% (bj-2) to 88.94% (bj-5). Results reveal the intervention as an opportunity for the branch of sports statistical analysis to create accurate predictive models while at the same time safeguarding athlete privacy.

There are tools that offer a catalogue of matches from multiple leagues, but the coverage of women's football is still very limited. Not only for match viewing, but it is also difficult to collect line-ups and substitutions from minor leagues. Viewing more than 2-3 leagues with continuity is complicated and on a data level there are still several steps to go before we can create metrics-based scouting processes, as we know in men's football. Within this context, we have created WTDTool, a tool capable of collecting basic information about players from around 30 leagues and the minutes played during the season. This information consists of data such as name, date of birth, position or height. In addition, important data in scouting processes is also collected, such as market value, contract expiry date or injuries that the players have had. Once all the information has been collected automatically, alert-generating processes are executed. This allows you to focus on a small number of players that meet specific criteria without having to carry out a search beforehand. We conducted an expert evaluation, all of them combining different roles within women's football, and they all agreed that WTDTool is an easy to use tool, useful in the scouting process, that helps to make the scouting process more efficient and that the alarms effectively put the spotlight on players likely to be scouted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","144 - 149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research proposed several SML models trained directly on a microcontroller, using the Motus ml proprietary libraries TinySML and TinySML-P, aiming at distinguishing between passing and non-passing actions from data on leg movements collected from sensors embedded in players' footwear. We compare these algorithms to well-known SML libraries trained on a quad-core/16GB RAM machine hosted in the cloud, evaluating their classification performance and resource usage.

NBA players face a variety of injuries, including muscle strains, ligament tears, bone fractures, sprains, and tendonitis, among others. Factors contributing to injury risk encompass a wide range of variables, including player physical characteristics, biomechanics, conditioning, fatigue, playing style, and history of previous injuries. Height, weight, wingspan, agility, sprint speed, and body fat percentage, which are the focus features of this study, can play pivotal roles in injury susceptibility.To address the multifaceted challenge of predicting injuries among NBA players based on various features, this project employs a range of machine learning models. Random Forest is utilized for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is applied for its instance-based learning that can classify players based on similar attributes, and Gradient Boosting is used to iteratively improve the model's predictions by focusing on the errors of previous iterations. These algorithms provide a robust framework for analyzing player data, enhancing the accuracy of injury predictions, and ultimately aiding in injury prevention and optimizing player performance. These models were evaluated using multiple metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy at 92.47%, followed by Gradient Boosting at 91.94%, and KNN at 88.17%.By analyzing historical injury data alongside these features, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay between player characteristics and injury risk and estimate injury probabilities. Through this approach, we provide valuable insight into injury prediction for NBA organizations, enhancing injury prevention and optimizing player performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","216 - 221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 4</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially relevant in sedentary scenarios, where individuals often maintain static postures for extended periods—a significant part of daily life for many. The development of a system capable of detecting FHP is crucial, as it would not only alert users to correct their posture but also serve the broader goal of contributing to public health by preventing the progression of chronic injuries associated with this condition. However, despite significant advancements in estimating human poses from standard 2D images, most computational pose models do not include measurements of the craniovertebral angle, which involves the C7 vertebra, crucial for diagnosing FHP. Objective: Accurate diagnosis of FHP typically requires dedicated devices, such as clinical postural assessments or specialized imaging equipment, but their use is impractical for continuous, real-time monitoring in everyday settings. Therefore, developing an accessible, efficient method for regular posture assessment that can be easily integrated into daily activities, providing real-time feedback, and promoting corrective action, is necessary. Methods: The system sequentially estimates 2D and 3D human anatomical key points from a provided 2D image, using the Detectron2D and VideoPose3D algorithms, respectively. It then uses a graph convolutional network (GCN), explicitly crafted to analyze the spatial configuration and alignment of the upper body’s anatomical key points in 3D space. This GCN aims to implicitly learn the intricate relationship between the estimated 3D key points and the correct posture, specifically to identify FHP. Results: The test accuracy was 78.27% when inputs included all joints corresponding to the upper body key points. The GCN model demonstrated slightly superior balanced performance across classes with an F<inf>1</inf>-score (macro) of 77.54%, compared to the baseline feedforward neural network (FFNN) model’s 75.88%. Specifically, the GCN model showed a more balanced precision and recall between the classes, suggesting its potential for better generalization in FHP detection across diverse postures. Meanwhile, the baseline FFNN model demonstrates a higher precision for FHP cases but at the cost of lower recall, indicating that while it is more accurate in confirming FHP when detected, it misses a significant number of actual FHP instances. This assertion is further substantiated by the examination of the latent feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, where the GCN model presented an isotropic distribution, unlike the FFNN model, which showed an anisotropic distribution. Conclusions: Based on 2D image input using 3D human pose estimation joint inputs, it was found that it is possible to learn FHP-related features using the proposed GCN-based network to develop a posture correction system. We conclude the paper by addressing the limitations of our current system and proposing potential avenues for future work in this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-09-29 14:51:21","2025-09-29 14:51:21","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past decade, scholars have utilized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in football for varied objectives, encompassing the analysis of football players' performances, injury prediction, market value forecasting, and action recognition. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of research addressing the evaluation of football players' performance, which is a noteworthy concern for coaches. Hence, the objective of this work is to categorize the performance of football players into active, normal, or weak based on activity features. This will be achieved through the utilization of the Performance Evaluation Machine Learning Model (PEMLM), employing two novel datasets that cover both training and match sessions. To attain this goal, seven machine learning methods are applied, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbor. The findings indicate that in the dataset corresponding to match sessions, the Decision Tree classifier attains the highest accuracy (100%) and the shortest test time.

The degree of the happenings depends on the workplace environment setting and the incident regulatory measures implemented. By the nature of its work environment, the oil and gas upstream sector is susceptible to high incident rates. In the current fierce business competition and practices, improving productivity, quality, and other processes, such as Safety, is vital. Implementing well-designed safety procedures is the key to managing and reducing the risk level of workplace incidents. Methods: Recently, the application of Machine learning (ML) modeling for accident/injury prediction has been reported in the construction, mining, transport, and health sectors. Likewise, the objective of this paper was to implement three machine-learning-based models to predict injury rates in a drilling operation. The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway provided the datasets. First, the dataset was pre-processed, and then the selected features and target dataset were used for the modeling. Finally, the model prediction and performance accuracy analysis were performed. Results: Results showed that multivariable regression (MVR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms-based models predict the test data with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9576, 0.793, and 0.97036, respectively. Conclusion: As the common saying goes, 'prevention is better than cure.' For this, implementing methods such as improved work processes and Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) mitigation procedures, workplace injuries, and accidents allow for reducing the risk level of workplace injuries. The application of integrated machine learning tools, along with carefully built-in workplace accident database implementation, will provide early detection and possible remedial precautions that can be taken to prevent workplace injuries/accidents/fatalities. However, extensive research and development are required to deploy the method in real life.

Methods: From a database of 6,010 patients undergoing M3M surgery, 25 patients met the inclusion criteria of bilateral M3M removal with postoperative unilateral IAN injury. In this within-patient controlled trial, preoperative PANO and CBCT images were available, while 3D-AI models of the mandibular canal and teeth were generated from the CBCT images using the Virtual Patient Creator AI platform (Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium). Five examiners, who were blinded to surgical outcomes, assessed the imaging modalities and assigned scores indicating the risk level of IAN injury (high, medium, or low risk). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) for IAN risk assessment were calculated for each imaging modality. Results: For IAN injury risk assessment after M3M removal, sensitivity was 0.87 for 3D-AI, 0.89 for CBCT versus 0.73 for PANO. Furthermore, the AUC and specificity values were 0.63 and 0.39 for 3D-AI, 0.58 and 0.28 for CBCT, and 0.57 and 0.41 for PANO, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the imaging modalities for any diagnostic parameters. Conclusion: This within-patient controlled trial study revealed that risk assessment for IAN injury after M3M removal was rather similar for 3D-AI, PANO, and CBCT, with a sensitivity for injury prediction reaching up to 0.87 for 3D-AI and 0.89 for CBCT.

A significant challenge during the pandemic has not only been the accurate detection of positive cases but also the efficient prediction of risks associated with complications and patient survival probabilities. These tasks entail considerable clinical resource allocation and attention. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net Biochem, a versatile and explainable framework for constructing machine learning models. We apply this framework to predict COVID-19 patient survival and the likelihood of developing Acute Kidney Injury during hospitalization, utilizing clinical and biochemical data in a transparent, systematic approach. The proposed approach advances machine learning model design by seamlessly integrating domain expertise with explainability tools, enabling model decisions to be based on key biomarkers. This fosters a more transparent and interpretable decision-making process made by machines specifically for medical applications. More specifically, the framework comprises two phases: In the first phase, referred to as the “clinician-guided design” phase, the dataset is preprocessed using explainable AI and domain expert input. To better demonstrate this phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully curated clinical and biochemical markers based on clinician assessments for survival and kidney injury prediction in COVID-19 patients. This dataset was selected from a patient cohort of 1366 individuals at Stony Brook University. Moreover, we designed and trained a diverse collection of machine learning models, encompassing gradient-based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures, specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the selected markers. In the second phase, called the “explainability-driven design refinement” phase, the proposed framework employs explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding of each model’s decision-making process but also to identify the overall impact of individual clinical and biochemical markers for bias identification. In this context, we used the models constructed in the previous phase for the prediction task and analyzed the explainability outcomes alongside a clinician with over 8 years of experience to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical validity of the decisions made. The explainability-driven insights obtained, in conjunction with the associated clinical feedback, are then utilized to guide and refine the training policies and architectural design iteratively. This process aims to enhance not only the prediction performance but also the clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Employing the proposed explainability-driven framework, we attained 93.55% accuracy in survival prediction and 88.05% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complications. The models have been made available through an open-source platform. Although not a production-ready solution, this study aims to serve as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, and citizen scientists to develop innovative and trustworthy clinical decision support solutions, ultimately assisting clinicians worldwide in managing pandemic outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 1; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Important motion data for the model are collected by micro-inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment.

These minor details might sometimes escape human notice. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders, who developed a computer algorithm recently that can assess any discomfort associated with sports. These little things can occasionally elude human vision. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown.

According to this study, team sports such as basketball and football have profited immensely from artificial intelligence (AI), but AI's full potential has yet to be achieved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate prediction of hepatotoxic compounds is crucial for safe drug development. Several DILI prediction models have been published, but they are built on different data sets, making it difficult to compare model performance. Moreover, most existing models are based on molecular fingerprints or descriptors, neglecting molecular geometric properties and lacking interpretability. To address these limitations, we developed GeoDILI, an interpretable graph neural network that uses a molecular geometric representation. First, we utilized a geometry-based pretrained molecular representation and optimized it on the DILI data set to improve predictive performance. Second, we leveraged gradient information to obtain high-precision atomic-level weights and deduce the dominant substructure. We benchmarked GeoDILI against recently published DILI prediction models, as well as popular GNN models and fingerprint-based machine learning models using the same data set, showing superior predictive performance of our proposed model. We applied the interpretable method in the DILI data set and derived seven precise and mechanistically elucidated structural alerts. Overall, GeoDILI provides a promising approach for accurate and interpretable DILI prediction with potential applications in drug discovery and safety assessment.

To optimize the responsibilities of physical teachers and coaches, efficient administration of physical education, including sports activities, and a strong quality assurance system are required. Based on the above, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sports management system to enhance work efficiency and ease of physical education teachers and coaches. It aims to make an in-depth study on the construction of sports performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining; later, it includes the construction of sports management systems. This paper operates in such a way that it first discusses the sports performance management and physical analysis system's construction. Second, it analyses the overall framework structure of the system by presenting a detailed description of the sports test management and test items management. In addition, it analyses sports performance management and sports performance, system management and physical performance and other functional modules contained in the system along with the database design in the system based on C4.5 that is then used as the Decision Tree (DT) Classifier for data mining. Third, it uses sports performance management of DT, and the physical analysis algorithm uses the data information gained to select the split attributes. Fourth, it divides the sports performance training data set into multiple sub-datasets to construct the performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining. Finally, the suggested system is compared with existing approaches and obtains an accuracy of 97%, which is 27% high than the selected approaches. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has high accuracy in data mining related to sports performance and can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of physical education teachers. The proposed system will be an addition to intelligent task management with high feasibility and accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","16331 - 16352","","21","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 11</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ski injuries are rare events, but they carry a high cost, that is, can cause working or movement disabilities. Usually, ski risk assessment is performed on small-scale, case-controlled studies where the effect of a single factor is evaluated. Recently, data mining and machine learning algorithms are being employed for ski risk assessment and injury prediction. However, these models do not generally satisfy the need for interpretation of the decision model, do not provide explanations for the predictions, and in general do not ensure the completeness and consistency of decision rules. To make data mining and machine learning models useful, one needs to implement the aforementioned properties. Decision support systems are expected to have these properties; however, the process of building such decision support systems is still tedious: it has to consider human biases, assumptions, and subjective values, as well as focus on the decision problem being solved. We propose a method for extraction of decision models from data at hand. Our method DIDEX, Data Induced DEcision eXpert, builds models that have desirable properties for inclusion in decision support systems. The proposed method is used to build a decision model for ski injury prediction based on data from Mt. Kopaonik ski resort, Serbia. The results show that DIDEX generates up to a five times simpler model compared to the existing domain expert DEX models while having a 6% better predictive accuracy. Additionally, its predictive accuracy is comparable to similar machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree classifiers, random forest, and logistic regression. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","3429 - 3454","","6","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 3; All Open Access; Bronze Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to build prediction models for falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling older adults in China. Methods: This study used data (Waves 2015 and 2018) from 5,818 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A total of 107 input variables at the baseline level were regarded as candidate features. Five machine learning algorithms were used to build the 3-year fall and fall-related injury risk prediction models. SHapley Additive exPlanations was used for the prediction model explanation. Analyses were conducted in 2022. Results: The logistic regression model achieved the best performance among fall and fall-related injury prediction models with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.739 and 0.757, respectively. Experience of falling was the most important feature in both models. Other important features included basic activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, depressive symptoms, house tidiness, grip strength, and sleep duration. The important features unique to the fall model were house temperature, sex, and flush toilets, whereas lung function, smoking, and Internet access were exclusively related to the fall-related injury model. Conclusions: This study suggests that the optimal models hold promise for screening out older adults at high risk for falls in facilitated targeted interventions. Fall prevention strategies should specifically focus on fall history, physical functions, psychological factors, and home environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","579 - 586","","4","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 22</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to i) determine the feasibility of and adherence to our monitoring approach, and ii) identify variables associated with up-coming illness and injury. We incorporated a comprehensive set of monitoring tools consisting of external load and physical fitness data, questionnaires, blood, neuromuscular-, hamstring, hip abductor and hip adductor performance tests performed over a three-month period in elite under-18 academy soccer players. Twenty-five players (age: 16.6 ± 0.9 years, height: 178 ± 7 cm, weight: 74 ± 7 kg, VO<inf>2max</inf>: 59 ± 4 ml/min/kg) took part in the study. In addition to evaluating adherence to the monitoring approach, data were analyzed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict illness and injuries. The approach was feasible, with no injuries or dropouts due to the monitoring pro-cess. Questionnaire adherence was high at the beginning and de-creased steadily towards the end of the study. An SVM resulted in the best classification results for three classification tasks, i.e., illness prediction, illness determination and injury prediction. For injury prediction, one of four injuries present in the test data set was detected, with 96.3% of all data points (i.e., injuries and non-injuries) correctly detected. For both illness prediction and deter-mination, there was only one illness in the test data set that was detected by the linear SVM. However, the model showed low pre-cision for injury and illness prediction with a considerable num-ber of false-positives. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a holistic monitoring approach with the possibility of predicting illness and injury. Additional data points are needed to improve the prediction models. In practical application, this may lead to over-cautious recommendations on when players should be protected from injury and illness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","475 - 486","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 12; All Open Access; Bronze Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, early prediction of AKI in patients with trauma is important for risk stratification and the provision of optimal intensive care unit treatment. This study aimed to compare 2 models, machine learning (ML) techniques and logistic regression, in predicting AKI in patients with trauma. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 400 patients who sustained torso injuries between January 2016 and June 2020. Patients were included if they were aged > 15 years, admitted to the intensive care unit, survived for > 48 hours, had thoracic and/or abdominal injuries, had no end-stage renal disease, and had no missing data. AKI was defined in accordance with the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition and staging system. The patients were divided into 2 groups: AKI (n = 78) and non-AKI (n = 322). We divided the original dataset into a training (80%) and a test set (20%), and the logistic regression with stepwise selection and ML (decision tree with hyperparameter optimization using grid search and cross-validation) was used to build a model for predicting AKI. The models established using the training dataset were evaluated using a confusion matrix receiver operating characteristic curve with the test dataset. We included 400 patients with torso injury, of whom 78 (19.5%) progressed to AKI. Age, intestinal injury, cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours, and the use of vasopressors were independent risk factors for AKI in the logistic regression model. In the ML model, vasopressors were the most important feature, followed by cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours and packed red blood cell transfusion within 4 hours. The accuracy score showed no differences between the 2 groups; however, the recall and F1 score were significantly higher in the ML model (.94 vs 56 and.75 vs 64, respectively). The ML model performed better than the logistic regression model in predicting AKI in patients with trauma.

Material and Methods: Fifty-six elite male youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years; height: 179 ± 8 cm; mass: 70.4 ± 9.2 kg) performed a 3D motion analysis, postural control testing, and strength testing. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to identify the most important injury predictors. Predictive performance of the LASSO model was determined in a leave-one-out (LOO) prediction competition. Results: Twenty-three non-contact injuries were registered. The LASSO model identified concentric knee extensor peak torque, hip transversal plane moment in the single-leg drop landing task and center of pressure sway in the single-leg stance test as the three most important predictors for injury in that order. The LASSO model was able to predict injury outcomes with a likelihood of 58% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.63 (sensitivity = 35%; specificity = 79%). Conclusion: The three most important variables for predicting the injury outcome suggest the importance of neuromuscular and biomechanical performance measures in elite youth soccer. These preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and planning, as well as for the development of customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors. However, the poor predictive performance of the final model confirms the challenge of predicting sports injuries, and the model must therefore be evaluated in larger samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","1021 - 1033","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 7; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the early talent identification of these riders largely remains a subjective assessment. Therefore, an analytical system which automatically detects talented riders based on their freely available youth results should be installed.

The aim of this paper is to develop such a data analytical system, which leverages the unique features of each race and thereby focusses on feature engineering, data quality, and visualization. To facilitate the deployment of prediction algorithms in situations without complete cases, we propose an adaptation to the k-nearest neighbours imputation algorithm which uses expert knowledge.

The emerging practice of medicine and public health supported by electronic processes and communication in sports medicine represents an opportunity for developing new injury risk reduction strategies. Modelling and predicting the risk of injury in real-time through artificial intelligence using machine learning techniques might represent an innovative injury risk reduction strategy. Thus, the primary aim of this study will be to analyse the relationship between the level of Injury Risk Estimation Feedback (I-REF) use (average score of athletes' self-declared level of I-REF consideration for their athletics activity) and the ICPR burden during an athletics season. Method and analysis We will conduct a prospective cohort study, called Injury Prediction with Artificial Intelligence (IPredict-AI), over one 38-week athletics season (from September 2022 to July 2023) involving competitive athletics athletes licensed with the French Federation of Athletics. All athletes will be asked to complete daily questionnaires on their athletics activity, their psychological state, their sleep, the level of I-REF use and any ICPR. I-REF will present a daily estimation of the ICPR risk ranging from 0% (no risk for injury) to 100% (maximal risk for injury) for the following day. All athletes will be free to see I-REF and to adapt their athletics activity according to I-REF. The primary outcome will be the ICPR burden over the follow-up (over an athletics season), defined as the number of days lost from training and/or competition due to ICPR per 1000 hours of athletics activity. The relationship between ICPR burden and the level of I-REF use will be explored by using linear regression models.

We use competition and training data of three world-class cyclists of Team Jumbo–Visma to construct personalised heart rate models that relate the heart rate during exercise to the pedal power signal. Our model captures the non-trivial dependency between exertion and corresponding response of the heart rate, which we show can be effectively estimated by an exponential kernel. To construct the daily heart rate models that are required for day-to-day fitness estimation, we aggregate all sessions in the previous week and apply sampling. On average, the explained variance of our models is 0.86, which we demonstrate is more than twice as large as for models that ignore the temporal integration involved in the heart’s response to exercise. We show that the fitness of a cyclist can be monitored by tracking developments of parameters of our heart rate models. In particular, we monitor the decay constant of the kernel involved, and also analytically determine virtual aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. We demonstrate that our findings for the virtual anaerobic threshold on average agree with the results of exercise tests. We believe this work is an important step forward in performance optimization by opening up avenues for switching to adaptive training programs that take into account the current physiological state of an athlete. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","1125 - 1153","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 9; All Open Access; Bronze Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In terms of CID global impact, around 1.7 billion people were affected in the last decade, and in 2020 alone, 30 million people were displaced due to CID. Furthermore, over the past two decades, 1 million deaths were reported and over $1.7 trillion in damage was attributed to CID. As such, the World Economic Forum, in its 2022 report, has identified climate action failure and extreme weather as the two most severe global risks to be considered over the next decade. Given the uncertainty and complexity associated with predicting CID frequencies and related impacts, the use of descriptive-, predictive- and prescriptive data analytics is key. To demonstrate the power of data analytics in predicting CID impacts, this work focuses on developing a data-driven machine learning model that predicts tornado-induced injuries based on a diverse set of input features ranging from hazard-, social-, geographic-, and climate-related features together with attributes related to community vulnerability, risk and resilience. These input features are then used to train and test various machine learning-based prediction models utilizing diverse techniques including decision trees, ensemble methods, and artificial neural networks. These models are subsequently evaluated to select the most significant features and the best performing model. In addition, several variable importance techniques are used to evaluate the dominance of all features and develop a model considering the most influential features. The results show that the best performing model had a testing accuracy of 83%. In addition, the results highlighted the apparent relationship between hazard-related attributes and tornadoes’ injury predictions. The developed approach is a step forward in harnessing the power of machine learning for improving our adaptation, preparedness, and planning towards global CID resilience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","3645 - 3667","","3","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As new jobs are created and commuting trips increase, traffic safety becomes even more important. Thus, this study presents one of the first efforts to study crash patterns for Southeast Michigan using machine learning models to analyze and predict crash severity in the region based on various contributing factors. We combine a three-step method of correlation analysis, machine learning predictive models, and spatial analysis to develop a rigid schema for crash prediction. Results show that decision tree classifiers provide accurate predictions and rapid computations. Also, spatial plots of predicted injury severities reveal disproportionate errors in model predictions at intersections prompting the need to stratify the crash data for further analyses. This significantly improves severe injury predictions at non-intersection locations and highlights pedestrians as a main important feature. The converse holds for intersections that identify motorcycles as the main feature for severity prediction.

The increment of the prediction ability is nowadays mandatory to reduce the high number of false positives. The aim of this study was to investigate if players’ blood sample profiles could increase the predictive ability of the models trained only on external training workloads. Method: Eighteen elite soccer players competing in Italian league (Serie B) during the seasons 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 took part in this study. Players’ blood samples parameters (i.e., Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, ferritin, and sideremia) were recorded through the two soccer seasons to group them into two main groups using a non-supervised ML algorithm (k-means). Additionally to external workloads data recorded every training or match day using a GPS device (K-GPS 10 Hz, K-Sport International, Italy), this grouping was used as a predictor for injury risk. The goodness of ML models trained were tested to assess the influence of blood sample profile to injury prediction. Results: Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, testosterone, and ferritin were the most important features that allowed to profile players and to analyze the response to external workloads for each type of player profile. Players’ blood samples’ characteristics permitted to personalize the decision-making rules of the ML models based on external workloads reaching an accuracy of 63%. This approach increased the injury prediction ability of about 15% compared to models that take into consideration only training workloads’ features. The influence of each external workload varied in accordance with the players’ blood sample characteristics and the physiological demands of a specific period of the season. Conclusion: Field experts should hence not only monitor the external workloads to assess the status of the players, but additional information derived from individuals’ characteristics permits to have a more complete overview of the players well-being. In this way, coaches could better personalize the training program maximizing the training effect and minimizing the injury risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","285 - 296","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 6; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interconnectivity of data acquisition devices with an AI-assisted computing platform in the Nx-IoT environment will not only allow the spectators to track the formation of their favorite players during a soccer match but will also enable the managerial staff to evaluate the players' performance in the soccer match as well as in practice sessions. This Nx-IoT-enabled salient event detection feature can be provided to spectators and sports' managerial staff as a financial technology (FinTech) service. In this article, we propose an efficient deep-learning-based framework for multiperson salient soccer event recognition in IoT-enabled FinTech. The proposed framework performs event recognition in three steps: 1) frames preprocessing; 2) frame-level discriminative features extraction; and 3) high-level events recognition in soccer videos. Moreover, we introduce a new soccer video events (SVE) data set containing videos of six salient events of soccer games. To provide a strong baseline, we evaluate our newly created SVE data set using different traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We also perform event recognition on untrimmed soccer videos using our proposed framework and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods. The obtained results validate the suitability of our proposed framework for salient event recognition in Nx-IoT environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","2202 - 2214","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 14; All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serious injuries have the potential to cause detrimental effects on a player's career, or even end it prematurely. Clubs also suffer when key players are injured; their game tactics may need to be changed to better fit the limited team members available, which can severely affect performance, especially in competitive leagues. The goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a large dataset to train an accurate Machine Learning model to predict injuries in professional-level soccer. Machine Learning algorithms used to solve this problem have historically had small datasets, which are prone to variance and unreliable results. Therefore, a larger dataset will be constructed from publicly available data to prove that a reliable injury prediction tool can be created. The data in this study will span multiple years and include data about player minutes, age, appearances, and whether they were recovering from an injury. The results of the study show that an injury prediction tool using Machine Learning is practical for use in professional-level soccer to help teams predict and prevent non-contact injuries sustained by athletes.

However, no machine learning model has emerged which has good performance and generalisability to multiple datasets. Focusing on explainable machine learning, this paper discusses possible limitations in common approaches to injury prediction, and investigates methods that might be able to overcome these limitations. In particular, we first examine the value that can be obtained by including daily records of psychological variables to provide a multi-modal perspective on athletes. Secondly, we consider whether models that focus on learning from local rather than global patterns in the data are better suited to modelling injuries. We explain how the diversity of injuries in terms of severity, duration, type (chronic versus acute) and context may make local models preferable. The local modelling approaches we consider include subgroup discovery, anomaly detection and casebased classification. Since the proposed approaches threaten to increase the model complexity, we take great care to ensure that explainability is maintained, and describe the ways in which each of our methods is explainable. This leads to a set of explainable, local models. To provide an empirical basis for the investigations, we perform a series of computational studies using data obtained by daily recording of professional association football players in the Netherlands over a period of two seasons. These studies aim to expand the currently limited literature on applying explainable ML methods to injury prediction. Our results indicate that predicting injuries is very difficult in general, while the focus of this paper is mainly on providing insights on explainability and interpretability. Therefore, alongside results detailing the performance of various machine learning models, we also include multiple examples of explanations that can be extracted using our proposed methods, which may support actionability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:22","2025-09-29 14:51:22","","949 - 957","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 0; All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, AI has been introduced to the sports domain including the football (soccer) industry with applications in injury prediction and tactical analysis. However, the fact remains that the more complex an AI model is, the less explainable it becomes. Its black-box nature makes it difficult for human operators to understand its results, interpret its decisions and ultimately trust the model itself. This problem is magnified when the decisions and results suggested by an AI model affect the functioning of complex and multi-layered systems and entities, with a football club being such an example. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged for making an AI model more explainable, understandable and interpretable, thus assisting the creation of human-centered AI models.

The present study proposes an artificial intelligence solution for acute kidney injury prediction in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: Data were collected from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, area under the precision–recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. Results: Logistic regression, XGBoost, and XGBoost with severity scores were used to predict acute kidney injury risk using all features. The XGBoost-based acute kidney injury predictive models including XGBoost and XGBoost+severity scores model showed greater accuracy, recall, precision AUC, AUC-PR, and F1 score compared to logistic regression. Conclusion: The XGBoost model obtained better risk prediction for acute kidney injury in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit than the traditional logistic regression model, suggesting that machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to improve the development and validation of predictive models in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 4; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, one of the key goals that all sectors of society are currently concerned about is how to build and develop community sports through more advanced technical means center. The innovative governance community sports center must effectively combine and integrate the current advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data, so that the level of community governance can be effectively improved. This paper draws on the academic background of 'governance' in the field of public management. Different from social management, 'governance' mainly reflects the administrative aspect, the cooperation between the government and all sectors of society, while the traditional social management mainly highlights the state's administrative management. It reflects the concept that the government's management power is inviolable and unshareable, which is also very different from the development direction of the gradual liberalization of the administrative power advocated by the Chinese government. Therefore, the effective way to solve various social problems at this stage is to change the concept of social management to community governance, and this approach has also been supported and valued by the government in recent years. The research shows that the management efficiency of community sports facilities can be effectively improved by optimizing the community sports governance system, making full use of the convenience brought by information resources, and using its own advanced technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","2069 - 2081","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although practitioners have conducted many studies on the relationship between physical fitness and the likelihood of injury, the relationship between the two remains indeterminate. Consequently, this study utilized machine learning to preliminary investigate the relationship between individual physical fitness tests and injury risk, aiming to identify whether patterns of physical fitness change have an impact on injury risk. Methods: This study conducted a retrospective analysis by extracting the records of 17 young female basketball players from the sport-specific physical fitness monitoring and injury registration database in Fujian Province. Sports-specific physical fitness tests included physical performance, physiological, biochemical, and subjective perceived responses. The data for each player was standardized individually using Z-scores. Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques and edited nearest neighbor algorithms were used to sample the training set to address the negative impact of class imbalance on model performance. Feature extraction was performed on the dataset using linear discriminant analysis, and the prediction model was constructed using the cost-sensitive neural network. Results: The 10 replicate 5-fold stratified cross-validation showed that the lower limb non-contact injury prediction model based on the cost-sensitive neural network had achieved good discrimination and calibration (average Precision: 0.6360; average Recall: 0.8700; average F2-Score: 0.7980; average AUC: 0.8590; average Brier-score: 0.1020), which could be well applied in training practice. According to the attribution analysis, agility and speed were important physical attributes that affect youth female basketball players’ non-contact lower limb injury risk. Specifically, there was enhance in the performance of the 1-min double under, accompanied by an increase in urinary ketone and urinary blood levels following the agility test. The 3/4 basketball court sprint performance improved, while urinary protein and RPE levels decreased after the speed test. Conclusion: The sport-specific physical fitness change pattern can impact the lower limb non-contact injury risk of young female basketball players in Fujian Province, specifically in terms of agility and speed. These findings will provide valuable insights for planning athletes’ physical training programs, managing fatigue, and preventing injuries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 6; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this inquiry was to conceive a machine learning model that can recognize preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative high-risk factors and predict the onset of myocardial injury following CME. Patients and Methods: This study included 1198 colon cancer patients, 133 of whom experienced myocardial injury after surgery. Thirty-six distinct variables were gathered, encompassing patient demographics, medical history, preoperative examination character-istics, surgery type, and intraoperative details. Four machine learning algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), were employed to fabricate the model, and k-fold cross-validation, ROC curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and external validation were employed to evaluate it. Results: Out of the four predictive models employed, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best performance. The ROC curve findings indicated that the XGBoost model exhibited remarkable predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.997 in the training set and 0.956 in the validation set. For internal validation, the k-fold cross-validation method was utilized, and the XGBoost model was shown to be steady. Furthermore, the calibration curves demonstrated the XGBoost model’s high predictive capability. The DCA curve revealed higher benefit rates for patients who underwent interventional treatment under the XGBoost model. The AUC value for the external validation set was 0.74, which indicated that the XGBoost prediction model possessed good extrapolative capacity. Conclusion: The myocardial injury prediction model for patients undergoing CME that was developed using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm in this study demonstrates both high predictive accuracy and clinical utility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","1251 - 1264","","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 6; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is made up of several algorithms that work together to identify patterns in the data. Machine learning provides many benefits over traditional regression techniques, including a lower necessity for a priori predictor information and a higher capacity for managing huge datasets. Recent research has made significant progress toward using machine learning more effectively in spinal cord injury (SCI). Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injuries. Non-traumatic spinal cord injuries often reflect degenerative spine conditions that cause spinal cord compression, such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. This article proposes a novel correlated graph model (CGM) that adopts correlated learning to predict various outcomes published in traumatic and non-traumatic SCI. In the studies mentioned, machine learning is used for several purposes, including imaging analysis and epidemiological data set prediction.

The experimental results show that GA-MDI outperforms the existing feature selection algorithms, while it is also validated that the model FCN-SE + MLP can effectively and accurately achieve the prediction of the severity of airway obstruction, which can assist clinicians in making treatment decisions for airway obstruction casualties.

A recent study described a series of models that outperformed previously published models in predicting acute kidney injury up to 48 h in advance, including a recurrent neural network that achieved state-of-the-art performance (area under the curve 0.92) and a gradient-boosted decision tree model that was close behind (area under the curve 0.89). Because these models were trained in a population of US veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its generalizability to other health systems where the populations are more sex balanced. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how well an acute kidney injury model trained in a population of US veterans performs in females at the Veterans Affairs and the extent to which its performance generalizes to a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting acute kidney injury in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of acute kidney injury and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of acute kidney injury. We demonstrate that, while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of characterizing the generalizability of artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","1121 - 1129","","12","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 25; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the development of nursing informatization, a large amount of structured and unstructured data has been generated, and it is difficult for traditional methods to utilize these data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence and nursing, it has become a new trend to apply machine learning algorithms to build pressure injury prediction models to manage pressure injuries. However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of the method and which of a large number of algorithms for machine learning is more applicable to pressure injuries. Objective: This review aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms for pressure injury management, to further evaluate and compare pressure injury prediction models constructed by numerous machine learning algorithms, and to derive evidence for the best algorithms for predicting and managing pressure injuries. Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic electronic search was conducted in the EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. We included all retrospective diagnostic accuracy trials and prospective diagnostic accuracy trials constructing a predictive model by machine learning for pressure injuries up to December 2021. Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The network meta-analysis was conducted using statistical software R and STATA. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Result: Twenty-five clinical diagnostic trials with a total of 237397 participants were identified in this review. The results of our study revealed that pressure injury machine learning models can effectively predict these injuries. Combining the algorithms separately yields the main results: decision trees (sensitivity: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.84, specificity: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96, diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]: 18, 95% CI: 7 to 49, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), logistic regression (sensitivity: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80, specificity: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89, DOR: 12, 95% CI: 9 to 17, AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.87), neural networks (sensitivity: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86, specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87, DOR: 9, 95% CI: 5 to 19, AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.85), random forests (sensitivity: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.95, specificity: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99, DOR: 56, 95% CI: 3 to 1258, AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), support vector machines (sensitivity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90, specificity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.93, DOR: 19, 95% CI: 6 to 54, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.90). According to the analysis of ROC and AUC values, random forest is the best algorithm for the prediction model of pressure injury. Conclusions: This review revealed that machine learning algorithms are generally effective in predicting pressure injuries, and after data merging, the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for pressure injury prediction. Further well-designed diagnostic controlled trials are recommended to strengthen the current evidence.

Due to the degree to which the camera can be affected by lighting and wearable sensors scantiness, neither one modality can capture the required data to perform the task confidently. That being the case, range sensors, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can complement the process to perceive the environment more robustly. Most recently, researchers have been exploring ways to apply convolutional neural networks to 3-D data. These methods typically rely on a single modality and cannot draw on information from complementing sensor streams to improve accuracy. This article proposes a framework to tackle human activity recognition by leveraging the benefits of sensor fusion and multimodal machine learning. Given both RGB and point cloud data, our method describes the activities being performed by subjects using regions with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and a 3-D modified Fisher vector network. Evaluated on a custom captured multimodal dataset demonstrates that the model outputs remarkably accurate human activity classification (90%).

This study aimed to analyze predictive modeling of injury risk based on body composition variables and selected physical fitness tests for elite football players through a sports season. The sample comprised 36 male elite football players who competed in the First Portuguese Soccer League in the 2020/2021 season. The models were calculated based on 22 independent variables that included players’ information, body composition, physical fitness, and one dependent variable, the number of injuries per season. In the net elastic analysis, the variables that best predicted injury risk were sectorial positions (defensive and forward), body height, sit-and-reach performance, 1 min number of push-ups, handgrip strength, and 35 m linear speed. This study considered multiple-input single-output regression-type models. The analysis showed that the most accurate model presented in this work generates an error of RMSE = 0.591.

Methodology: Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Facebook Prophet (Prophet) models were used for time series prediction of the number of RTIs inpatients. The three models were trained using data from 2015 to 2019, and their prediction accuracy was compared using data from 2020 as a test set. The parameters of the SARIMA model were determined using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). The LSTM uses linear as the activation function, the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function and the Adam optimizer to construct the model, while the Prophet model is built on the Python platform. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to measure the predictive performance of the model. Findings: In this research, the LSTM model had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the Prophet model, and the SARIMA model had the lowest prediction accuracy. The trend in medical expenditure of RTIs inpatients overlapped highly with the number of RTIs inpatients. Conclusion: By adjusting the activation function and optimizer, the LSTM predicts the number of RTIs inpatients more accurately and robustly than other models. Compared with other models, LSTM models still show excellent prediction performance in the face of data with seasonal and drastic changes. The LSTM can provide a better basis for planning and management in healthcare administration. Implication: The results of this research show that it is feasible to accurately forecast the demand for healthcare resources with seasonal distribution using a suitable forecasting model. The prediction of specific medical service volumes will be an important basis for medical management to allocate medical and health resources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 19; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in machine learning has demonstrated success in AKI risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs). However, to prevent AKI, it is critical to identify clinically modifiable factors and understand their impact at different prevention windows. Method: We extracted 4129 clinical variables including demographics, social history, past diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, vitals from EHRs for a cohort of 144,084 eligible inpatient encounters. We developed a multi-view learning framework for XGBoost (MV-XGB) to enhance algorithm attention on modifiable factors. To study effects of modifiable factors at different time points, we built AKI prediction models at 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours before AKI onset. To characterize the temporal changes in effect of modifiable factors on AKI, we derived two indicators, inter-class score-difference and exposed-score-difference, based on SHAP values to compare effects of modifiable factors in different windows. Result: MV-XGB effectively increased attention on modifiable factors (explained 92.4%-94.1% inter-class score-difference, i.e., predictive difference between AKI and non-AKI samples) while maintaining good predictive performance (AUROCs were 0.854, 0.798, 0.765 in models for 24–48-72 h AKI prediction respectively). We observed that 62% of predicted odds-ratio difference between AKI and non-AKI patients in 24 h can be explained by factors occurring between 24 and 72 h. Among the important modifiable factors, electrolyte balance explained 38.3% of the inter-class score difference increase between 24 h and 72 h, followed by high-risk medications (13.7%), care strategy (12.1%), blood pressure (10%), infection (7.8%), and anemia (5.4%). Effects of cardiac surgery or condition, respiratory ventilation, and anemia remained important longer than 72 h. Conclusion: Better understanding of the clinically modifiable factors is important to AKI prevention. The proposed multi-view learning approach improved the identification of modifiable factors of AKI and allowed characterization of the temporal dynamics of their potential benefit in intervention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 2; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although corners are repeatable and static situations, due to their low conversion rates, several studies in literature failed to find useable insights about the efficiency of various corner strategies. Our work aims to fill this gap. We hand-label the role of each defensive player from 213 corners in 33 matches, where we then employ an augmentation strategy to increase the number of data points. By combining a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory neural network, we are able to detect the defensive strategy of each player based on positional data. We identify which of seven well-established roles a defensive player conducted (player-marking, zonal-marking, placed for counterattack, back-space, short defender, near-post, and far-post). The model achieves an overall weighted accuracy of 89.3%, and in the case of player-marking, we are able to accurately detect which offensive player the defender is marking 80.8% of the time. The performance of the model is evaluated against a rule-based baseline model, as well as by an inter-labeller accuracy. We demonstrate that rules can also be used to support the labelling process and serve as a baseline for weak supervision approaches.

It directly leads to the high wear attrition of the drug. At present, there are a variety of computer algorithms based on molecular representations to predict DILI. It is found that a single molecular representation method is insufficient to complete the task of toxicity prediction, and multiple molecular fingerprint fusion methods have been used as model input. In order to solve the problem of high dimensional and unbalanced DILI prediction data, this paper integrates existing datasets and designs a new algorithm framework, Rotation-Ensemble-GA (R-E-GA). The main idea is to find a feature subset with better predictive performance after rotating the fusion vector of high-dimensional molecular representation in the feature space. Then, an Adaboost-type ensemble learning method is integrated into R-E-GA to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the performance of R-E-GA is better than other state-of-art algorithms including ensemble learning-based and graph neural network-based methods.

A review of existing literature on player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) Cricket. We propose a Deep Player Performance Index (DPPI) to evaluate a T20 Cricket player based on batting and bowling strengths. DPPI captures a player's current form and role in the team. DPPI serves a dual purpose. First, it enables sports fans and researchers to compare players playing a similar role in different teams. Second, the aggregated DPPI values of players playing at different positions in a team give the approximate team strength. To build DPPI, we first modify the existing Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) player performance evaluation guidelines. We then use the modified guidelines in the context of T20 Cricket. We propose DPPI based on K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithm and compare our results with the existing player performance evaluation indexes for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 season. Our empirical results show that DPPI captures a player's batting and bowling strength better than other indexes. Thus, DPPI serves as a helpful index for fantasy Cricket users, Cricket fans, coaches, and managers to gain better insights into a player's performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 11; All Open Access; Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: The ensemble model exhibited high predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.88, sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.77, F1-score of 0.82, and accuracy of 0.80. When a test dataset collected from the literature was used to compare the performance of our model with publicly available DILI prediction models, our model achieved an accuracy of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.72, and F1-score of 0.79, which were higher than those of the other DILI prediction models. As many pub-lished DILI prediction models are not available for public access, which hinders in silico drug discov-ery, we made our DILI prediction model publicly accessible (http://ssbio.cau.ac.kr/software/dili/). Conclusion: We expect that our ensemble model may facilitate advancements in drug discovery by providing a highly predictive model and reducing the drug withdrawal rate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","296 - 303","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 8</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An increase in serum creatinine leads to impairment in renal function of the kidney and significantly increases the mortality rate. Early detection of AKI could lead to preventive interventions, therefore machine learning systems can detect AKI before its symptoms and consequences appear. Methods: We used a machine learning technique like boosted ensembles of decision trees along with novel kidney biomarkers to predict AKI using retrospective data extracted from the MIMIC-III dataset. Results: Our proposed algorithm achieved high AUROC for diagnosing and predicting AKI with novel kidney biomarkers. For AKI prediction at the point of onset, the algorithm achieved an AUROC of 0.890 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.878). Also, our proposed algorithm obtained an AUROC of 0.82 (95 percent CI, 0.792-0.809) for predictions made 12-hours before onset and an AUROC of 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.785-0.804) for 24-hours predictions.

The data used in the study are derived from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III, which is a freely accessible database of de-identified ICU-related data. The paper focuses on two different phases. The first one consists of a scrupulous phase of extraction and transformation of MIMIC data to retrieve all the criteria specified in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline definition of AKI. The main features included are demographics, medications, comorbidities, charted vital signs, and laboratory events. In the second phase, we used several different techniques already used to predict AKI, and we also added a complex temporal feature, called Trend-Event Feature (TE-F). The prediction was performed using a rolling observational window design that includes the data collection window (length: 1 to 6 days) and the prediction window (7 days). The Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) method was used, with different groups of features, to predict the risk of AKI. To evaluate the GBDT performances, we used the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), Recall, Precision, and F-score measures. We observed that lab parameters contribute the most to the prediction of the AKI risk. Moreover, adding TE-Fs to different groups of features leads to better performance results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","669 - 676","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Obtaining player identities is essential for analyzing the game and is used in downstream tasks such as game event recognition. Transformers are the existing standard in natural language processing (NLP) and are swiftly gaining traction in computer vision. Motivated by the increasing success of transformers in computer vision, we introduce a transformer network for recognizing players through their jersey numbers in broadcast National Hockey League (NHL) videos. The transformer takes temporal sequences of player frames (called player tracklets) as input and outputs the probabilities of jersey numbers present in the frames. The proposed network performs better than the previous benchmark on the same dataset. We implement a weakly-supervised training approach by generating approximate frame-level labels for jersey number presence and use the frame-level labels for faster training. We also utilize player shifts available in the NHL play-by-play data by reading the game time using optical character recognition (OCR) to get the players on the ice rink at a certain game time.

But for the lower leagues, it becomes difficult to hire the same talents because of strict budget. Here we devise a method so that we can leverage the undervalued players to get selected by the clubs. Clearly the benefit will be in two fold.

These techniques are used for linearising the negative maximum likelihood (neML) function and enabling backpropagation of the neML derivatives. Our approach is tested on two real-life datasets. Firstly, on high frequency point process data, (prediction of highway traffic) and secondly, on a very low frequency point processes dataset, (prediction of ski injuries in ski resorts). Four different point process baseline models were compared: second-order Polynomial inhomogeneous process, Hawkes process with exponential kernel, Gaussian process, and Poisson process. The results show the ability of the proposed methodology to generalize on different datasets and illustrate how different numerical integration techniques and mathematical models influence the quality of the obtained models.

Biomechanical analyses of throwing athletes have identified pathomechanic factors that predispose throwers to injury or poor performance. These factors, or key performance indicators, are an ongoing topic of research, with the goals of improved injury prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation. Important key performance indicators in the literature to date include shoulder and elbow torque, shoulder rotation, kinetic chain function (as measured by trunk rotation timing and hip-shoulder separation), and lower-extremity mechanics (including stride characteristics). The current gold standard for biomechanical analysis of the throwing athlete involves marker-based 3-dimensional) video motion capture. Emerging technologies such as marker-less motion capture, wearable technology, and machine learning have the potential to further refine our understanding.

Early prediction of DILI can bring a significant reduction in the cost of clinical trials. In this work we examined whether occurrence of DILI can be predicted using gene expression profile in cancer cell lines and chemical properties of drugs. Methods: We used gene expression profiles from 13 human cell lines, as well as molecular properties of drugs to build Machine Learning models of DILI. To this end, we have used a robust cross-validated protocol based on feature selection and Random Forest algorithm. In this protocol we first identify the most informative variables and then use them to build predictive models. The models are first built using data from single cell lines, and chemical properties. Then they are integrated using Super Learner method with several underlying methods for integration. The entire modelling process is performed using nested cross-validation. Results: We have obtained weakly predictive ML models when using either molecular descriptors, or some individual cell lines (AUC ∈(0.55−0.61)).

Although injuries are difficult to forecast, novel technologies and data-science applications could provide important insights. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs. Methods: Prediction of injuries was evaluated on a new data set of 74 high-level middle- and long-distance runners, over a period of 7 years. Two analytic approaches were applied. First, the training load from the previous 7 days was expressed as a time series, with each day’s training being described by 10 features. These features were a combination of objective data from a global positioning system watch (eg, duration, distance), together with subjective data about the exertion and success of the training. Second, a training week was summarized by 22 aggregate features, and a time window of 3 weeks before the injury was considered. Results: A predictive system based on bagged XGBoost machine-learning models resulted in receiver operating characteristic curves with average areas under the curves of 0.724 and 0.678 for the day and week approaches, respectively. The results of the day approach especially reflect a reasonably high probability that our system makes correct injury predictions. Conclusions: Our machine-learning-based approach predicts a sizable portion of the injuries, in particular when the model is based on training-load data in the days preceding an injury. Overall, these results demonstrate the possible merits of using machine learning to predict injuries and tailor training programs for athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","1522 - 1531","","10","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 37; All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is not only to automatically identify this strategy, but also to derive metrics that support coaches with the analysis of transition situations. Additionally, we want to infer objective influence factors for its success and assess the validity of peer-created rules of thumb established in by practitioners. Based on a combination of positional and event data we detect counterpressing situations as a supervised machine learning task. Together, with professional match-analysis experts we discussed and consolidated a consistent definition, extracted 134 features and manually labeled more than 20, 000 defensive transition situations from 97 professional football matches. The extreme gradient boosting model—with an area under the curve of 87.4 % on the labeled test data—enabled us to judge how quickly teams can win the ball back with counterpressing strategies, how many shots they create or allow immediately afterwards and to determine what the most important success drivers are. We applied this automatic detection on all matches from six full seasons of the German Bundesliga and quantified the defensive and offensive consequences when applying counterpressing for each team. Automating the task saves analysts a tremendous amount of time, standardizes the otherwise subjective task, and allows to identify trends within larger data-sets. We present an effective way of how the detection and the lessons learned from this investigation are integrated effectively into common match-analysis processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","2009 - 2049","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 52; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The MIMIC III database was used for internal validation, and the eICU-CRD database was used for external validation. For all three machine learning algorithms, the prediction performance from using only the key indicator dataset was very close to that from using the full dataset. The XGBoost algorithm performed the best, and LR was the next best. The decision tree performed the worst.

Although early prediction of AKI has the potential to reduce adverse patient outcomes, it remains a difficult condition to predict and diagnose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict for AKI as defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 or 3 up to 48 hours in advance of onset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and patient electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: A CNN prediction system was developed to use EHR data gathered during patients’ stays to predict AKI up to 48 hours before onset. A total of 12,347 patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. An XGBoost AKI prediction model and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system were used as comparators. The outcome was AKI onset. The model was trained on routinely collected patient EHR data. Measurements included area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, positive predictive value (PPV), and a battery of additional performance metrics for advance prediction of AKI onset. Results: On a hold-out test set, the algorithm attained an AUROC of 0.86 and PPV of 0.24, relative to a cohort AKI prevalence of 7.62%, for long-horizon AKI prediction at a 48-hour window before onset. Conclusion: A CNN machine learning-based AKI prediction model outperforms XGBoost and the SOFA scoring system, revealing superior performance in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset, without reliance on serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","1289 - 1298","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 50; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res 35(4): 910-919, 2021-This study used machine learning (ML) to predict injuries among adolescents by functional movement testing. This research is a part of the CRO-PALS study conducted in a representative sample of adolescents and analyses for this study are based on nonathletic (n = 364) and athletic (n = 192) subgroups of the cohort (16-17 years). Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), body fatness, moderate-To-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), training hours per week, Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and socioeconomic status were assessed at baseline. A year later, data on injury occurrence were collected. The optimal cut-point of the total FMS score for predicting injury was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve. These predictors were included in ML analyses with calculated metrics: Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with associated criterium of total FMS score >12 showed AUC of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.48-0.59) and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.47-0.63), for the nonathletic and athletic youth, respectively. However, in the nonathletic subgroup, ML showed that the Naïve Bayes exhibited highest AUC (0.58), whereas in the athletic group, logistic regression was demonstrated as the model with the best predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.62). In both subgroups, with given predictors: sex, age, BMI, body fat percentage, MVPA, training hours per week, socioeconomic status, and total FMS score, ML can give a more accurate prediction then FMS alone. Results indicate that nonathletic boys who have lower-body fat could be more prone to suffer from injury incidence, whereas among athletic subjects, boys who spend more time training are at a higher risk of being injured. Conclusively, total FMS cut-off scores for each subgroup did not successfully discriminate those who suffered from those who did not suffer from injury, and, therefore, our research does not support FMS as an injury prediction tool. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","910 - 919","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 23</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective.—To determine the impact of point-of-care (POC) AKI biomarker enhanced by machine learning (ML) algorithms in burn-injured and trauma patients. Design.—We conducted a 2-phased study to develop and validate a novel POC device for measuring neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine from blood samples. In phase I, 40 remnant plasma samples were used to evaluate the analytic performance of the POC device. Next, phase II enrolled 125 adults with either burns that were 20% or greater of total body surface area or nonburn trauma with suspicion of AKI for clinical validation. We applied an automated ML approach to develop models predicting AKI, using a combination of NGAL, creatinine, and/or UOP as features. Results.—Point-of-care NGAL (mean [SD] bias: 9.8 [38.5] ng/mL, P ¼ .10) and creatinine results (mean [SD] bias: 0.28 [0.30] mg/dL, P ¼ .18) were comparable to the reference method.

It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","550 - 565","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 62; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. In the past, traditional machine learning methods such as logistic regression and XGBoost mainly used laboratory data and the statistical features of vital signs data to predict the occurrence of AKI. These methods have achieved good predictive performance, but the statistical values obviously cannot represent all the information of vital signs data. Therefore, a TCN-based model is proposed in this paper. The patient's vital signs data in the ICU, laboratory examination data, and statistical features of monitoring data are fused as input to the model. Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced into our model to discover more useful temporal features by calculating the independence between statistics and monitoring data. In addition, we also explore the impact of changes in vital signs on the occurrence of AKI based on complete vital signs data. Numerical experiments were carried out on the public data set MIMIC-III. Compared with the four baseline models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Long-Short Term Memory Network, and XGBoost), our model showed excellent performance. In the ablation experiment, the effectiveness of HSIC in mining temporal features is proven.

Based on the country's strong support for traditional national sports, the dragon boat has developed into a traditional national sport with specific influence and popularity among the masses. Eggshell membrane (ESM) has the effect of relieving arthritis, joint pain, and joint stiffness. The supplementary ESM's preventive effect on sports injuries has attracted people's attention. Based on this, this article builds a sports injury prediction model under artificial intelligence and big data monitoring to accurately predict the injuries suffered by athletes, provide help to reduce athletes' injuries during training, and promote the development of dragon boat sports. This article selects 20 members of a dragon boat team from a university and randomly divides them into a control group (supplement of equal amounts of whey protein), a normal group, an ESM low-dose group (26 mg/kg bw/d), and an ESM high-dose group (52 mg/kg bw/d), with 5 people in each group. The subjects were subjected to downhill exercise and immune stimulation experiments. Among them, the subjects in the control group performed downhill exercise for 12 hours, and they were tested for lactic acid (LAC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, malondialdehyde (MDA), hemoglobin (Hb), blood creatinine (CRE), and other related physical and chemical indicators. The other three groups of subjects did not take low-dose and high-dose ESM for 7 consecutive days and were injected with lipopolysaccharide on the 8th day for immune stimulation and tested for interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10), and other related cytokines. The results show that oral egg membrane protein (ESM) can reduce subjects' serum LAC, LDH, urea, MDA, Hb, and CRE concentration. In addition, the ESM can reduce the expression of proinflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α, while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, which provides clinical data for the clinical use of ESM as a supplement for sports injury or for relieving arthritis symptoms. The study shows that egg membrane protein has a protective effect against sports injury and may be regulated by inflammatory factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 3; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there is no hybrid model predicting AKI that takes advantage of two types of data. In this research, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for AKI prediction was created using de-identified numeric patient data and ultrasound kidney images. Using data features including serum creatinine among others, two numeric models using MIMIC-III and paired hospital data were developed, and with the hospital ultrasounds, an image-only model was developed. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used, including VGG and Resnet, and they were made into a hybrid model by concatenating feature maps of both types of models to create a new input. The hybrid model successfully predicted AKI and the highest AUROC of the model was 0.953, the first time an AKI machine learning model surpassed an AUROC of 0.9. The model also achieved an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of 0.91. This model can be implemented into urgent clinical settings such as the ICU and aid doctors by assessing the risk of AKI shortly after the patient’s admission to the ICU. The implementation of this research has great potential to be applied to different medical predictive applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","1329 - 1345","","15","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 6</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to changes in athlete training methods, it has been decided that athletes must bear a great risk of sports injuries. Accurate prediction of injuries is very important for the development of youth soccer. Based on this, this paper proposes a text classification algorithm based on machine learning and builds a sports injury prediction model that can accurately predict athlete injuries, reduce athlete injuries during training, and be effective. We put forward various sports suitable for young athletes, and put forward some measures to prevent and alleviate athletes' injuries. This article selects 48 football players from a college of physical education of a university for testing. The athletes participating in the experiment use professional equipment to collect exercise volume and exercise load data, and real-time records of each athlete's physical fitness data within half a year, through the athlete's exercise volume, exercise load, body metabolism, and physical indicators to predict their sports injury. Experiments show that from the degree of injury, it can be seen that the severe injury is the least, with 5 cases of muscle injury, 2 cases of fascia ligament injury, and 1 case of joint injury. There were 25 cases of mild injuries, accounting for 41.0% of the total. This is because the athlete's sports injury prediction model has better prediction capabilities, allowing athlete coaches and therapists to optimize training courses, ultimately preventing injuries, improving training levels, and reducing rehabilitation costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 17; All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently the development of methods based on machine learning algorithms has provided researchers with more powerful tools to more accurate prediction in different domains and evaluate the factors affecting different phenomena more reliably than traditional regression models. This study tries to investigate the performance of random forest (RF) in identifying factors associated with sports-related dental injuries. Also, the accuracy of the RF model for predicting sports-related dental injuries was compared with logistic regression model as traditional competitor. Methods: This cross-sectional study was applied to 356 athlete children aged 6 to 13-year-old in Hamadan, Iran. Random forest and logistic regression constructed by using sports-related dental injuries as response variables and age, sex, parent’s education, child’s birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, mouthguard use as input. A self-reported questionnaire was used to obtain information. Results: Fifty-five (15.4%) subjects had experienced a sports-related dental injury. The mean age of children with sports injuries was significantly higher than children without the experience of injury (p = 0.006). The prevalence of injury was significantly higher in boys (p = 0.008). Children with illiterate mothers are more likely to be injured than children with educated mothers (p = 0.045). Awareness of mouthguard and its use during exercise has a significant effect on reducing the prevalence of injury among users (p < 0.001). Random forest model has a higher prediction accuracy (89.3%) for predicting sports-related dental injuries compared to the logistic regression (84.2%). The results of the relative importance of variables, based on RF showed, mouthguard use, and mouthguard awareness has more contributed importance in dental sport-related injuries’ prediction. Subsequently, the importance of sex and age is in the next position. Conclusions: Using predictive models such as RF challenges existing inaccurate predictions due to high complexity and interactions between variables would be minimized. This helps to achieve more accurate identification of factors in sport-related dental injury among the general population of children. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 14; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury. Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation. Results: The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two–hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours). Conclusion: Machine learning applied to routinely collected ED data identified ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury up to 72 hours before they met diagnostic criteria.

Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics—such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)—and brain tissue deformation-based metrics—such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods obtained significantly different (p < 0.01) values as well as substantial differences in injury classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data set of any size.

Unlike static regression analyses that provide a momentary prediction, ML algorithms are dynamic in that they are readily capable of imbibing historical data to build a framework that improves with additive data. Purpose: To (1) characterize the epidemiology of publicly reported NHL injuries from 2007 to 2017, (2) determine the validity of a machine learning model in predicting next-season injury risk for both goalies and position players, and (3) compare the performance of modern ML algorithms versus logistic regression (LR) analyses. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Professional NHL player data were compiled for the years 2007 to 2017 from 2 publicly reported databases in the absence of an official NHL-approved database. Attributes acquired from each NHL player from each professional year included age, 85 performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 5 ML algorithms were created for both position player and goalie data: random forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Top 3 Ensemble. LR was also performed for both position player and goalie data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 2109 position players and 213 goalies. For models predicting next-season injury risk for position players, XGBoost performed the best with an AUC of 0.948, compared with an AUC of 0.937 for LR (P <.0001).

A method to predict which individuals might be more susceptible to injury would be valuable, especially in the military where basic recruits may be discharged from service due to injury. We postulate that certain body characteristics may be used to predict risk of injury with physical activity. Methods US Army basic training recruits between the ages of 17 and 21 (N = 17,680, 28% female) were scanned for uniform fitting using the 3D body imaging scanner, Human Solutions of North America at Fort Jackson, SC. From the 3D body imaging scans, a database consisting of 161 anthropometric measurements per basic training recruit was used to predict the probability of discharge from the US Army due to injury. Predictions were made using logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Model comparison was done using the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC curve. Results The ANN model outperformed two other models, (ANN, AUC = 0.70, [0.68,0.72], logistic regression AUC = 0.67, [0.62,0.72], random forest AUC = 0.65, [0.61,0.70]). Conclusions Body shape profiles generated from a three-dimensional body scanning imaging in military personnel predicted dischargeable physical injury. The ANN model can be programmed into the scanner to deliver instantaneous predictions of risk, which may provide an opportunity to intervene to prevent injury. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","","","6 June","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 11; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we establish a network-based “response feature matrix” to characterize the magnitude and distribution of impact-induced brain strains. The network nodes and edges encode injury risks to the gray matter regions and their white matter interconnections, respectively. The utility of the metric is illustrated in injury prediction using three independent, real-world datasets: two reconstructed impact datasets from the National Football League (NFL) and Virginia Tech, respectively, and measured concussive and non-injury impacts from Stanford University. Injury predictions with leave-one-out cross-validation are conducted using the two reconstructed datasets separately, and then by combining all datasets into one. Using support vector machine, the network-based injury predictor consistently outperforms four baseline scalar metrics including peak maximum principal strain of the whole brain (MPS), peak linear/rotational acceleration, and peak rotational velocity across all five selected performance measures (e.g., maximized accuracy of 0.887 vs. 0.774 and 0.849 for MPS and rotational acceleration with corresponding positive predictive values of 0.938, 0.772, and 0.800, respectively, using the reconstructed NFL dataset). With sufficient training data, real-world injury prediction is similar to leave-one-out in-sample evaluation, suggesting the potential advantage of the network-based injury metric over conventional scalar metrics. The network-based response feature matrix significantly extends scalar metrics by sampling the brain strains more completely, which may serve as a useful framework potentially allowing for other applications such as characterizing injury patterns or facilitating targeted multi-scale modeling in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","927 - 942","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 27; All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The former needs a lot of manpower and the evaluation is inevitably subjective. The latter can only record the quantity of a player's match events, but cannot reflect the quality (e.g., a wonderful shot or a terrible shot is regarded as a shot). To solve the above problems, an improved evaluation method for soccer player performance using affective computing is proposed. On the basis of statistics, our method also takes advantage of the text information of post-match reports, and employ the affective computing technology to quantify the quality of events. In this way, both the quantity and quality of events are considered. All the players in the Chinese Super League 2019 season are selected as evaluation objects, and the results show that the improved method can evaluate player performance more effectively and reasonably. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","324 - 329","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 4</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goalkeeper has to guess the ball flight trajectory within a fraction of a second and typically jumps to either side of the goalpost taking (often mistakenly) cues from the kicker. These cues are postulated in goalkeeper's mind based on the kicker's posture, run-up, and angle of attack at the ball. Statistical analysis of historical data helps pundits to identify beneficial strategies in such a competitive environment but these tactical knowledge is of marginal help to a novice soccer player for improving their penalty kickout and blocking skills. Oftentimes, players are not equally skilled at successfully placing the ball around different sections of the goalpost. To empower players with a retrospective view of their performance and identifying the strong versus weak shots, and blocking capabilities, it's crucial to detect the direction, force, and trajectory of the shots. In this work, we propose a wearable sensor-based approach to detect the outcome of various goal shots from the kicker's dominant foot movement profile. We empirically assign six hot-zones inside the goal post and collect data on a real-life penalty shoot-out using economically available accelerometer sensors from four participants. We develop a deep learning approach for the shot classification and we report superior (53%) accuracy over traditional approaches (47%) in a challenging setting of recognizing different goal shots from the segmented data stream. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:25","2025-09-29 14:51:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 7</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, machine learning-based Dili prediction can be key in increasing the success rate of drug discovery because drug candidates that are predicted to potentially induce liver injury can be rejected before clinical trials. However, existing Dili prediction models mainly focus on the chemical structures of drugs. Since we cannot determine whether a drug will cause liver injury based solely on its structure, Dili prediction based on the transcriptional effect of a drug on a cell is necessary. In this paper, we propose GLIT which is a model that uses transcriptional response data and chemical structures and can be used for drug-induced liver injury prediction. GLIT learns the embedding vectors of drug structures and drug-induced gene expression profiles using graph attention networks in a biological knowledge graph for predicting Dili. GLIT outperformed a baseline model that uses only drug structure information by 7% and 19.2% in terms of correct classification rate (CCR) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively. In addition, we conducted a literature survey to confirm whether the class labels of drugs, in the unknown Dili class, predicted by GLIT are correct. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:25","2025-09-29 14:51:25","","323 - 329","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 13</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: To determine the validity of an ML model in predicting the next-season injury risk and anatomic injury location for both position players and pitchers in the MLB. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Using 4 online baseball databases, we compiled MLB player data, including age, performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 84 ML algorithms were developed. The output of each algorithm reported whether the player would sustain an injury the following season as well as the injury’s anatomic site. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 1931 position players and 1245 pitchers, with a mean follow-up of 4.40 years (13,982 player-years) between the years of 2000 and 2017. Injured players spent a total of 108,656 days on the disabled list, with a mean of 34.21 total days per player. The mean AUC for predicting next-season injuries was 0.76 among position players and 0.65 among pitchers using the top 3 ensemble classification. Back injuries had the highest AUC among both position players and pitchers, at 0.73. Advanced ML models outperformed logistic regression in 13 of 14 cases. Conclusion: Advanced ML models generally outperformed logistic regression and demonstrated fair capability in predicting publicly reportable next-season injuries, including the anatomic region for position players, although not for pitchers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:25","2025-09-29 14:51:25","","","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 44; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has long been recognized as a common and important complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). In the study, machine learning (ML) techniques were used to establish predictive models for AKI in AP patients during hospitalization. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of AP patients admitted within one week after the onset of abdominal pain to our department from January 2014 to January 2019. Eighty patients developed AKI after admission (AKI group) and 254 patients did not (non-AKI group) in the hospital. With the provision of additional information such as demographic characteristics or laboratory data, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to build models of AKI prediction and compared to the predictive performance of the classic model using logistic regression (LR). XGBoost performed best in predicting AKI with an AUC of 91.93% among the machine learning models. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 87.28%. Present findings suggest that compared to the classical logistic regression model, machine learning models using features that can be easily obtained at admission had a better performance in predicting AKI in the AP patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:25","2025-09-29 14:51:25","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 32; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
