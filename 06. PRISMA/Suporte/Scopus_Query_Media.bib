	abstract = {Basketball remains among the most globally popular sports, with its various competitions drawing substantial attention. The analysis and modeling of basketball game data have long been central topics in sports analytics. In recent years, integrating machine learning techniques has facilitated significant advancements in predicting basketball game outcomes. However, most existing studies predominantly focus on NBA data, with relatively limited exploration of other leagues. To address this research gap, this study utilizes game data from the Chinese Basketball Association spanning the 2021–2024 seasons to develop predictive models. This research is the first to apply the classical Four Factors model and DefenseOfense model, along with their derivative versions (Four Factors detailed model and DefenseOfense detailed model), to the Chinese Men’s Professional Basketball League, providing a baseline for prediction. To ensure practical applicability of the models and enable their effective use in real-world scenarios, this study exclusively uses data available before the start of each game as feature variables for training. This approach ensures that the enhanced models can perform well in theoretical evaluations and provide reliable predictions when applied in practice. To evaluate model performance, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron with contrastive loss, and XGBoost are employed, with metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and AUROC used for comparison. The results reveal that the incorporation of additional features substantially enhances predictive performance. In particular, under the Logistic Regression framework, the newly developed model based on the Four Factors detailed achieves an accuracy of 85.49%, representing the highest predictive performance among all the evaluated approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Purpose of this study is to propose a new integrative framework for athletic performance prediction based on state-of-the-art machine learning analysis and biometric data biometric scanning. By merging physiological signals i.e., Heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, muscle activation patterns, with psychological signals i.e., mental toughness, athlete engagement, group cohesion along with contextual training data, we create a hybrid model that performs superiorly as compared to traditional unidimensional models. Our exercisers were trained using a gradient boosting and neural network to learn the very complex non-linear relationships that exist between the physical and the psychological performance drivers. With a rich sample set of 480 athletes from different sports, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) in predicting performance outcomes and outdid the conventional methods with statistical approaches R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) and machine learning based methods (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) And machine whiz methods. The robust results achieved from the model (over 90%) as compared to conventional nor statistical methods. From the analysis of the features’ importance, the strongest predictor of performance are the Provided Dedicated Athletes’ scores of the Functional Movement Screening (13.7%), athlete dedication (11.5%), maximum acceleration capabilities (10.2%), which verify the relationship along biomechanical, preconceived explosive power and psychological commitment. This reflects the finding whereby deep categorized athletic talent prediction requires a multi-dimensional approach by sophisticated fusion techniques. The framework is useful to coaches and sports scientists because it allows for the individualized design of injury risk mitigation and physiologically and psychologically-focused interpersonal help. This approach integrates multiple factors and constitutes an important progress in sports analytics by providing a comprehensive perspective on the complex realities which influence elite athletic performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The significance of human sports activities recognition (HSAR) in many computing applications, including sports analytics, smart surroundings, and healthcare monitoring is huge. The current use of vision sensors for HSAR is a difficult task due to the intricate movements involved in sports and fitness workouts, as well as fluctuations in illumination conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) and their usage for human sports activities classification based on sensor data called ML-HSAR is presented in this article. A dataset containing 19 different human activities gathered from 8 different people through different types of sensors was used for this work; the dataset contains activities like sitting and standing, as well as other activities that require serious movements, such as running, cycling, and playing basketball. This study primarily aims to determine the performance of the considered ML models in accurately classifying these activities found in the dataset. The training of the algorithms and the subsequent evaluation were done on the segmented sensor data, effectively leveraging the dataset’s temporal aspect. In addition to the presented results for each of these algorithms, the limitations of each algorithm and their strengths in handling the complexities involved in HSAR were also presented. The contribution of this analysis is towards the understanding of the most appropriate ML models for HSAR tasks; it also offers valuable insights for future research and practical applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basketball Action Recognition (BAR) has received increasing attention in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence, serving as a fundamental component in performance evaluation, automated game annotation, tactical analysis, and referee decision-making support. Despite notable advancements driven by deep learning approaches, BAR remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of basketball movements, frequent occlusions, and limited availability of standardized benchmark datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured synthesis of current developments in BAR research, encompassing four principal dimensions: dataset curation, computational methodologies, synthetic data generation, and model explainability. A critical analysis of publicly available basketball-specific datasets is presented, delineating their modalities, annotation strategies, action taxonomies, and representational scope. Furthermore, the survey offers a structured classification of state-of-the-art action recognition methodologies, ranging from video-based and skeleton-based models to sensor-driven and multimodal fusion approaches, emphasizing architectural characteristics, evaluation protocols, and task-specific adaptations. The role of synthetic data is systematically examined as a means to address data scarcity, reduce annotation noise, and enhance model generalization through controlled variability and simulation-based augmentation. In parallel, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques is also analyzed, with a focus on post-hoc attribution methods, probabilistic reasoning models, and interpretable neural architectures, aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of decision-making processes. The survey identifies persisting research challenges, including dataset heterogeneity, limitations in cross-domain transferability, and the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in deep models. By delineating current limitations and prospective directions, this work provides a foundational reference to guide the development of robust, generalizable, and explainable BAR systems for deployment in real-world sports intelligence applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A two-step evaluation and validation process secured validity, while applying linear optimization methodology, considering constraints such as salary and player position to recommend an eight-player line-up for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS). Four scenarios with 14 machine learning models and meta-models with a blending approach with an ensembling methodology were evaluated. Using individual per-player modeling, standard and advanced features, and different timespans resulted in accurate, well-established, and well-generalized predictions. Standard features improved MAPE results by 1.7–1.9% in the evaluation and 0.2–2.1% in the validation set. Additionally, two model selection cases were developed, with average scoring MAPEs of 28.90% and 29.50% and MAEs of 7.33 and 7.74 for validation sets. The most effective models included Voting Meta-Model, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge, AdaBoost, and Elastic Net. The research demonstrated practical application using predictions in a real-life DFS case evaluated in a DFS tournament on a specific match day. Among 11,764 real users, our Daily Line-up Optimizer ranked in the top 18.4%, and profitable line-ups reached the top 23.5%. This unique approach proves the proposed methodology's effectiveness and emphasizes its profitability, as the optimizer process delivers positive results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of sports analytics and artificial intelligence, accurate human pose estimation in badminton is becoming increasingly important. However, challenges such as the lack of domain-specific datasets and the complexity of athletes’ movements continue to hinder progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced pose estimation framework tailored to badminton players, built upon an improved YOLOv8-Pose architecture. In particular, we introduce an efficient local attention (ELA) mechanism that effectively captures fine-grained spatial dependencies and contextual information, thereby significantly improving the keypoint localization accuracy and overall pose estimation performance. To support this study, we construct a dedicated badminton pose dataset comprising 4000 manually annotated samples, captured using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The raw data undergo careful processing and refinement through a combination of depth-assisted annotation and visual inspection to ensure high-quality ground truth keypoints. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple attention modules and their integration strategies within the network, offering generalizable insights to enhance pose estimation models in other sports domains. The experimental results show that the proposed ELA-enhanced YOLOv8-Pose model consistently achieves superior accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), object keypoint similarity (OKS), and percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), highlighting its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sports vision tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data science has become an essential component in professional sports, particularly for predicting team performance and outcomes. This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models that accurately predict game outcomes in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). Method: A total of 859 games from the 2021 to 2023 regular seasons were analyzed, using both traditional baseball statistics and advanced sabermetric indicators such as the Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA), and Percentage of Leadoff Batters on Base (PLOB%). Five machine learning models—decision tree, logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were constructed and assessed through a five-fold cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, F1 scores, sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC-ROC. Results: Among the models, logistic regression and XGBoost achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 and an AUC-ROC from 0.97 to 0.98. The feature importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that the wRC+ and PLOB% were the most influential predictors, reflecting the offensive efficiency and pitching control. Conclusion: The results suggest that combining interpretable machine learning with sabermetrics provides valuable insights for coaches and analysts in professional baseball.

	abstract = {The increasing integration of data-driven approaches and machine learning (ML) in sports presents a significant opportunity to optimize performance, predict outcomes, and refine strategies, especially in badminton. Despite its promise, challenges such as the lack of comprehensive datasets, limited use of advanced ML techniques, insufficient focus on tactical decision-making, and the underutilization of predictive analytics in training remain prevalent. To develop a predictive model that analyzes technical and tactical decisions in badminton, enhancing strategy development and performance evaluation for competitive gameplay, the proposed method, Puffer Fish Algorithm-tuned Intelligent Support Vector Machine (PFA-INT-SVM), combines the benefits of Pufferfish mutation with INT-SVM to improve prediction accuracy and classification tasks. The model utilizes data that encompasses player performance metrics, shot types, match context, opponent behavior, physical conditions, environmental factors, and tactical decisions. One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features, while normalization standardizes numerical data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that PFA-INT-SVM significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

	abstract = {In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence, machine vision, and the Internet of Things have significantly impacted sports analytics, particularly basketball, where accurate measurement and analysis of player performance have become increasingly important. This study proposes a real-time goal state recognition system based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, focusing on four shooting scenarios: rebounds, swishes, other shots, and misses. By installing IMU sensors around the basketball net, the system captures real-time data on acceleration, angular velocity, and angular changes to comprehensively analyze the fluency and success rate of shooting execution, utilizing five deep learning models—convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM-Attention—to classify shot types. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM-Attention model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 87.79% in identifying goal states. This result represents a commanding level of real-time goal state recognition, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the model in complex sports environments. This high accuracy not only supports the application of the system in skill analysis and sports performance evaluation but also lays a solid foundation for the development of intelligent basketball training equipment, providing an efficient and practical solution for athletes and coaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The significance of data analysis in high-performance sports has largely increased in recent years, offering opportunities for further exploration using machine learning techniques. SailGP is a relatively new sailing event driven by a passion for speed and innovation. The racing series brings excitement and thrill to the world of sailing that has been relatively unexplored. As a pioneer work in the academic community, our work showcases the power of data-driven approaches in enhancing performance and decision-making at high-performance sailing events. We explore data mining techniques on datasets collected at high-performance sailing events in Bermuda in 2021 and Italy in 2023. By analysing race data, the study aims to gain insights into the relationship between variables such as wind speed, wind direction, foil usage, and daggerboard adjustments, and their impact on boat speed. For a comprehensive understanding, we used three distinct methodologies. Various prediction models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and a stacked model, were employed and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score and mean squared error. The results demonstrate the models’ ability to accurately predict boat speed. Anomaly detection techniques examined boat stability, adding a new chapter to the research. Additionally, we introduced a reinforcement learning approach to identify optimal settings for speed enhancement, representing another new dimension of the study. These findings refine race strategies, optimise sail and rudder settings, and improve performance in SailGP races. Future plans include collaborating with SailGP to work with larger datasets and integrate models into live racing scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Predicting sports outcomes is still a challenging assignment because of some unpredictable factors such as player performance, weather, and tactical decisions. Traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms, like logistic regression and XGBoost, have had limited success in capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional data. In this study we explore the novel application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the outcome of sports event. Leveraging CNNs’ ability to identify intricate patterns, the proposed method shows improved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score compared to other six traditional models, achieving up to 93%- 97%, 87.8%-92.2%, 91.5%-96.5% and 90.7-92.9 respectively. Besides, while there are some fluctuations influenced by Gaussian noise, the four targets of our model are still much higher than other traditional models, and both of results could show the stability and reliability of the model. The result of these could not only indicate that CNN offers a promising method for enhancing sports analytics, but also permits reliable and accurate predictions of complicated datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study explores the way NBA player performance metrics evolve from quarter to quarter and affect game outcomes. Using Association Rule Mining, we identify key offensive, defensive, and overall impact metrics that influence success in both regular-season and playoff contexts. Defensive metrics become more critical in late-game situations, while offensive efficiency is paramount in the playoffs. Ball handling peaks in the second quarter, affecting early momentum, while overall impact metrics, such as Net Rating and Player Impact Estimate, consistently correlate with winning. In the collected dataset we performed preprocessing, applying advanced anomaly detection and discretization techniques. By segmenting performance into five categories—Offense, Defense, Ball Handling, Overall Impact, and Tempo—we uncovered strategic insights for teams, coaches, and analysts. Results emphasize the importance of managing player fatigue, optimizing lineups, and adjusting strategies based on quarter-specific trends. The analysis provides actionable recommendations for coaching decisions, roster management, and player evaluation.

The discrete nature of volleyball scores, particularly the number of sets won, aligns well with binomial parameter estimators. While existing literature explores methods such as logistic regression, Bayesian approaches, and machine learning techniques, binomial estimation offers a simpler and more versatile approach that suits various scenarios in practice. This article introduces and compares six estimation methods for volleyball match prediction, all based on modified estimators of the binomial parameter. Simulations were conducted to forecast the outcome of the FIVB Volleyball Women’s Nations League 2023. Our findings indicate that the model using traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) outperforms others, as evidenced by metrics such as Mean Square Error and Kendall’s Tau. While the TMLE demonstrates the highest predictive accuracy, it is important to recognize the advantages of models that adjust the estimation of the probability for tail values.

	abstract = {This paper introduces an advanced framework for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) and Semantic Event Classification (SEC), addressing the growing demand for sophisticated human skeleton modeling, context-aware feature extraction, and machine learning techniques for accurate event recognition in real-world scenarios. HPE, a fundamental task in applications such as sports analytics and surveillance systems, involves predicting human joint locations from visual data. Despite substantial progress driven by deep learning advancements, particularly in handling occlusions and crowded environments, a comprehensive integration of these innovations remains limited in current literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel HPE and SEC system featuring a robust six-stage pipeline. The workflow begins with preprocessing steps, including video-to-image sequence conversion, floor removal to reduce noise, grayscale transformation, and human silhouette extraction via binary masks. Human detection is performed using the GrabCut algorithm. Full-body feature extraction incorporates 1-D Fourier Transform, 2-D energy-based motion analysis, 0–180° intensity mapping via the Radon Transform algorithm, and movable body part detection using Fourier-Based Correlation. Key point features are characterized through the degree of freedom, human landmark detection via the HSV algorithm, and angular point analysis using the media pipe algorithm. Features are then optimized using the Ray Optimizer and classified through a Neuro-Fuzzy classifier. The proposed system achieves classification accuracies of 94.82%, 92.33%, and 93.63% on the UCF Sports Actions, Human Action Recognition (HAR), and MPII Human Pose datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling real-world challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received considerable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical survey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference for machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking to comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL. We begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic framework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These include deterministic or stochastic en-vironments, environments with limited demonstrations, and multiple agents. For each con-text, we illustrate the critical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle these issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic environments for evaluating ICRL agents.

	abstract = {Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in sports analytics has transformed decision-making pro- cesses, enhancing fairness and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel AI-driven image recognition system for automatically detecting offside and foul events in football matches. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention or traditional image processing techniques, our approach utilizes a hybrid deep learning model that combines advanced object tracking with motion analysis to deliver real-time, precise event detection. The system employs a robust, self-learning algorithm that leverages spatiotemporal features from match footage to track player movements and ball dynamics. By analyzing the continuous flow of video data, the model detects offside positions and identifies foul types such as tackles, handballs, and dangerous play—through a dynamic pattern recognition process. This multi- tiered approach overcomes traditional methods’ limitations by accurately identifying critical events with minimal latency, even in complex, high-speed scenarios. In experiments conducted on diverse datasets of live match footage, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.85% for offside detection and 98.56% for foul identification, with precision rates of 98.32% and 97.12%, respectively. The system's recall rates of 97.45% for offside detection and 96.85% for foul recognition demonstrate its reliability in real-world applications. It's clear from these results that the proposed framework can automate and greatly enhance the accuracy of match analysis, making it a useful tool for both referees and broadcasters. The system's low computational overhead and growing ability make connecting to existing match broadcasting infrastructure easy. This establishes an immediate feedback loop for use during live games. This work marks a significant step forward in applying AI and computer vision for sports, introducing a powerful method to enhance the objectivity and precision of officiating in football. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Injury prediction in athletes is a critical aspect of sports medicine, where early identification is essential for minimizing the risk of severe injuries and enhancing athletic performance. This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to assess injury risk by analyzing key physiological metrics such as heart rate, impact force, activity duration, and skin temperature. A dataset containing athlete performance data under different conditions is examined to identify the predictive relevance of these features. Traditional classification methods faced challenges due to the non-collinear nature of the data, whereas boosting techniques proved to be the most effective, delivering the highest prediction accuracy. This research evaluates various ML models, including boosting algorithms, neural networks, and conventional classifiers, comparing their predictive capabilities. Using AutoML, AutoGluon determined that the Weighted Ensemble model outperformed other approaches, achieving an accuracy of 81.17%. To complement the injury prediction model, this study also incorporates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Training Recommendation Model, which dynamically adjusts training regimens based on real-time physiological and biomechanical feedback. By optimizing training intensity and workload distribution, the RL model helps minimize injury risk while ensuring an appropriate and effective training regimen. The recommendation system is designed to be flexible, allowing for continuous adaptation and improvement as more data becomes available. This integrated approach enhances informed decision-making for coaches, medical professionals, and athletes, facilitating proactive injury prevention while maintaining peak performance levels. By leveraging ML-driven injury prediction and RL-based training recommendations, this study presents a comprehensive, scalable, and adaptable framework for athlete management.

By integrating AI with advanced statistical models, sports professionals can gain deeper insights into player efficiency, tactics, and injury prevention. Traditional sports analysis methods rely on subjective assessments, basic statistical tools, and manual video analysis, which often result in inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and delayed decision-making. These limitations hinder optimal performance evaluation and proactive injury prevention. To address these challenges, we propose the Machine Learning for Performance Analysis and Injury Prediction (ML-PA-IP) framework, which integrates AI-driven machine learning models for real-time player performance tracking, biometric monitoring, and predictive injury analysis.

It utilizes deep learning algorithms for player movement recognition, predictive analytics for injury risk assessment, and AI-based recommendations for optimizing training regimens. Findings indicate that ML-PA-IP significantly improves performance assessment accuracy, reduces injury occurrences by identifying risk factors in advance, and enhances game strategy through AI-driven insights.

	abstract = {In recent years, sports data analysis has emerged as a rapidly growing research field, becoming one of the core aspects of modern sports management. It can assist coaches and sports managers in predicting match outcomes and evaluating team and player performance. One of the most popular sports competitions, the NBA basketball games, has been the subject of numerous studies where various machine learning (ML) models have been used to predict game outcomes. However, previous research has primarily focused on traditional machine learning models, often overlooking the complex relationships between players within a team and their performance in interaction with other teammates. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid model to predict NBA teams' qualification for the playoffs, utilizing complete game data from the 2007-2008 to 2017-2018 seasons. The experiments in this study were based on three different data scenarios: team statistical features on a per-game basis, purely network-based features, and finally, a combination of statistical and network features of the games. The results of this study indicate that the use of the hybrid approach significantly increased prediction accuracy across various models. Furthermore, in the hybrid approach, both the Logistic Regression and XGBoost models, with an accuracy of 93%, demonstrated the best performance compared to other models.

Therefore, in this study, we introduce PassAI, a novel machine learning framework for classifying soccer passes success or failure using spatiotemporal tracking images and player-specific statistical profiles. PassAI addresses these challenges with an original dual-stream architecture that processes image-based and tabular features separately and then combines them for final prediction. Additionally, a two-stage explanation module was implemented to provide interpretable insights from both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. This module allows end users (e.g., coaches and analysts) understand whether pass outcomes depend more on contextual dynamics or individual player traits. In experiments involving 6,349 passes from professional Japanese soccer league games, PassAI outperformed state-of-the-art models - including convolutional neural network-based and graph neural network-based approaches, as well as existing pass prediction models - by more than 5% in accuracy. It also provided interpretable feedback through visual saliency maps and feature sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, RemOve And Retrain was also performed to verify the faithfulness of the generated explanation, and the visual saliency maps were highly faithful.

However, postoperative rehabilitation remains a crucial challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for enhancing physical recovery and quality of life. Personalized sports recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging sports analytics, machine learning, and biomechanical modeling to tailor rehabilitation exercises. Traditional methods rely on generalized rehabilitation protocols, often failing to consider individual patient conditions, recovery progress, and biomechanical constraints. These limitations hinder optimal rehabilitation and prolong recovery times. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating robotic-assisted assessment with personalized sports analytics. Our approach utilizes a Dynamic Sports Performance Network (DSPN), which combines spatiotemporal data analysis, reinforcement learning, and real-time feedback mechanisms to optimize exercise recommendations. By incorporating multi-agent learning and predictive modeling, the system adapts rehabilitation plans based on patient performance, ensuring a tailored and effective recovery process. The system can integrate wearable sensor data and EMG signals to further refine exercise precision and monitor muscular responses in real time. Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional rehabilitation strategies, offering higher precision in exercise recommendations, improved adherence rates, and enhanced recovery efficiency.

This paper addresses the critical problem of inconsistent and non-adaptive performance benchmarking, which limits objective comparisons across players, teams, and historical data. We propose a novel data-driven framework leveraging machine learning (ML) to create an adaptive benchmarking system that automatically evaluates performance trends, identifies anomalies, and provides actionable insights. Our approach integrates deep learning, reinforcement learning, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale datasets, including biometrics, match statistics, and contextual variables. A key innovation is the hybrid ML pipeline combining supervised and unsupervised learning, where neural networks and clustering algorithms work together to dynamically rank and compare athlete performances based on evolving game conditions. Furthermore, we introduce anomaly detection and regression-based models to detect deviations from expected performance trends and offer personalized recommendations for training optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving superior accuracy in performance evaluation compared to conventional statistical methods. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to enhance transparency and ensure interpretability of model outputs for coaches, analysts, and athletes.

However, the high cost of commercial systems and the disturbing nature of wearable devices limit their accessibility and practicality. This study presents a two-fold solution: first, the development of a low-cost, non-intrusive optical motion capture system; and second, the implementation of a machine learning model to classify cricket batting shots based on body angle variations over time. After evaluating multiple optical techniques, MediaPipe was identified as the most effective and affordable solution. A system comprising four Logitech 720p cameras was deployed using Python multiprocessing to capture player motion in real time, ensuring efficient handling of both computational and input/output operations. Motion data collected from the system was analyzed to extract distinct angle variation patterns associated with different batting shots. These patterns were used to train a hybrid machine learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 95% in classifying various batting shots, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the system as an economical alternative for sports motion analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basketball games generate a great amount of data across various dimensions, including player performance, team dynamics, and game outcomes. This makes basketball an ideal field for data analysis. In this study, we build upon previous researches to explore the prediction of NBA game outcomes based on key performance metrics such as points, rebounds and assists. We used several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests, to assess their prediction ability. We also used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE to better understand the hidden structures of team performance. Our findings indicate that logistic regression with optimal regularization and random forest models achieved the highest accuracy and ROC AUC scores, demonstrating their potential for predicting win/loss outcomes. We also explored the impact of feature selection and hyperparameter, which provides valuable insights into our model's optimization. Although traditional machine learning techniques performed well, future research could add more performance factors, deal with imbalanced data, and explore deep learning approaches to further improve predictive accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Forecasting within signal processing pipelines is crucial for mitigating delays, particularly in predicting the dynamic movements of objects such as NBA players. This task poses significant challenges due to the inherently interactive and unpredictable nature of sports, where abrupt changes in velocity and direction are prevalent. Traditional approaches, including (S)ARIMA(X), Kalman filters (KF), and Particle filters (PF), often struggle to model the non-linear dynamics present in such scenarios. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers, offer greater flexibility and accuracy but frequently fail to explicitly capture the interplay between temporal dependencies and contextual interactions, which are critical in chaotic sports environments.In this paper, we evaluate these models and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results reveal key performance trade-offs across input history length, generalizability, and the ability to incorporate contextual information. ML-based methods demonstrated substantial improvements over linear models across forecast horizons of up to 2s. Among the tested architectures, our hybrid LSTM augmented with contextual information achieved the lowest final displacement error (FDE) of 1.51m, outperforming temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN), graph attention network (GAT), and Transformers, while also requiring less data and training time compared to GAT and Transformers. Our findings indicate that no single architecture excels across all metrics, emphasizing the need for task-specific considerations in trajectory prediction for fast-paced, dynamic environments such as NBA gameplay. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Advanced techniques for handling missing data points using combined object detection and 3D landmark extraction to track the batsman's move-ments are employed for efficiency. To enhance accuracy of the analysis, complex methods are used to deal with missing data. By integrating object detection methods with 3D land-mark extraction, effective tracking of batsman movements is captured. Tests with multiple machine learning models such as simple neural networks and more complicated models which could capture movement sequence over time are tested on the data.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel framework for soccer game prediction using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, initially focusing on the Dutch Eredivisie League and later expanding to include the Scottish Premiership and the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. The methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and testing. Various models are evaluated, including enhanced versions of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Network, and Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network. Unlike existing studies that focus on end-of-game features, this research incorporates real-time features like half-time results and goals for in-game decision-making. Advanced data normalization and sampling methods, such as SVM-SMOTE and Near-Miss, are applied to improve model performance. Models are assessed using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area under the ROC Curve. Results indicate that the Feedforward Neural Network excels in predicting game results, while Logistic Regression is best for predicting under and over 2.5 goals. The integration of Random Forest and XGBoost in a voting model consistently achieves the highest accuracy across both prediction tasks. The combined use of data from the three leagues further validates the models’ robustness and generalizability. This study demonstrates the potential of machine and deep learning to enhance soccer game predictions through advanced techniques and comprehensive data analysis, making significant contributions to sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable tool in various fields of human activity, including action recognition. With the advancements in machine learning and deep learning technologies, AI's capabilities in analyzing and interpreting actions performed by humans or objects in video and audio recordings have significantly increased. This progress has led to the development of numerous applications such as surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, sports analytics, and autonomous driving, where understanding and recognizing actions is crucial. Traditional methods of action recognition relied heavily on handcrafted features and classical machine learning algorithms, which often struggled with the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The emergence of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), has revolutionized this field by enabling models to learn hierarchical representations directly from raw data, thus improving performance and robustness.

	abstract = {Featured Application: The information obtained from this study can be useful for coaches and performance analysts of teams. By taking into account the factors that contribute to securing one of the top positions in the league standings, coaches are encouraged to adopt ball possession strategies with patience and short passes to create gaps in the opponent’s defense and, at the right moment, execute through balls aiming to enter the attacking third and create goal opportunities. On the other hand, teams are advised to avoid long passes, as these may lead to a loss of team cohesion and create large distances between the lines. Finally, this information is also useful for team scouts in identifying players who are suitable for implementing the aforementioned strategies. Introduction: Performance analysis is essential for coaches and a topic of extensive research. The advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has revolutionized sports analytics. Aim: The primary aim of this article is to present a robust, explainable machine learning (ML) model that identifies the key factors that contribute to securing one of the top three positions in the standings of the French Ligue 1, ensuring participation in the UEFA Champions League for the following season. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from all 380 matches of the 2022–23 French Ligue 1 season. The data were obtained from the publicly-accessed website “whoscored” and included 34 performance indicators. This study employed Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) and various ML algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to create a robust, explainable model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) model was used to enhance model interpretability. Results: The K-means Cluster Analysis categorized teams into groups (TOP TEAMS, 3 teams/REST TEAMS, 17 teams), and the ML models provided significant insights into the factors influencing league standings. The LR classifier was the best-performing classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75.13%, a recall of 76.32%, an F1-score of 48.03%, and a precision of 35.17%. “SHORT PASSES” and “THROUGH BALLS” were features found to positively influence the model’s predictions, while “TACKLES ATTEMPTED” and “LONG BALLS” had a negative impact. Conclusions: Our model provided satisfactory predictive accuracy and clear interpretability of results, which gave useful information to stakeholders. Specifically, our model suggests adopting a strategy during the ball possession phase that relies on short passes (avoiding long ones) and aiming to enter the attacking third and the opponent’s penalty area with through balls. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There has been an explosion of data collected about sports. Because such data is extremely rich and complex, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Designing these indicators requires paying careful attention to a number of subtle issues from a methodological and evaluation perspective. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for handling them. Methodologically, we highlight that dependencies affect how to perform data partitioning for evaluation as well as the need to consider contextual factors. From an evaluation perspective, we draw a distinction between evaluating the developed indicators themselves versus the underlying models that power them. We argue that both aspects must be considered, but that they require different approaches. We hope that this article helps bridge the gap between traditional sports expertise and modern data analytics by providing a structured framework with practical examples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of athletic performance has always aroused great interest from sport scientist. This study utilized machine learning methods to build predictive models using a comprehensive CrossFit (CF) dataset, aiming to reveal valuable insights into the factors influencing performance and emerging trends. METHODS: Random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to predict performance in four key weightlifting exercises within CF: clean and jerk, snatch, back squat, and deadlift. Performance was evaluated using R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>) values and mean squared error (MSE). Feature importance analysis was conducted using RF, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models. RESULTS: The RF model excelled in deadlift performance prediction (R<sup>2</sup>=0.80), while the MLR model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in clean and jerk (R<sup>2</sup>=0.93). Across exercises, clean and jerk consistently emerged as a crucial predictor. The feature importance analysis revealed intricate relationships among exercises, with gender significantly impacting deadlift performance. CONCLUSIONS: This research advances our understanding of performance prediction in CF through machine learning techniques. It provides actionable insights for practitioners, optimize performance, and demonstrates the potential for future advancements in data-driven sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The models were applied on a filtered pool of 90 high-performance players. This study developed individual forecasting scenarios per player and experimented using all 14 models. The models’ performance ranking was developed using a bespoke evaluation metric, called weighted average percentage error (WAPE), formulated from the weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation results of each forecasted statistic and model. Moreover, we employed a comprehensive forecasting approach to improve KPI's results. Results showed that Tree-based models, namely Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, are the best performers in most of the forecasted performance indicators, with the best performance achieved by Extra Trees with a WAPE of 34.14%.

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the performance metrics that underpin team success in the dynamic professional basketball world is crucial. This study originated in the context of increasing academic and professional interest in performance analytics, focusing on how teams in elite leagues, such as the Euroleague and their respective national leagues, adapt and perform based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs). Purpose: The primary objective of this research is to bridge the existing bibliographic gap by comparing the effectiveness of various KPIs in predicting match outcomes in both the Euroleague and National Basketball Leagues. This comparison aims to identify how strategic adaptations and performance measures differ according to the unique demands and styles of the respective competitions. Methodology: The study utilized two main datasets: One encompassing all Euroleague 2022–23 matches and the other compiling cumulative statistics from Euroleague teams over three seasons. Machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, were employed along with the Boruta algorithm for feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for the interpretability of the model output. Results: The analysis identified that certain KPIs, such as the effective field goal percentage, defensive ratings, and assists-to-turnover ratio, vary significantly in their impact on game outcomes between Euroleague and National League games. These variations imply that teams may need to tailor their strategies depending on the league in which they play. Conclusions: This study significantly advances the field of sports analytics by providing a detailed comparative analysis of basketball performance metrics across two competitive settings. It offers practical insights that can help coaches and analysts optimize team performance and strategic planning. Moreover, sophisticated data analysis techniques have allowed for a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that influence basketball game outcomes, thereby making a significant contribution to the literature and practice of sports performance analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In elite sports, athletic excellence demands meticulous performance preparation and a sound health status. This paper overviews the current propositions and applications of pervasive computing and data analytics and our vision on how they should be used in future frameworks to contribute to the optimal balance of athletes’ performance and health requirements. Two main areas will be discussed. The first area is Sports Performance Optimization, in which we consider interesting recent advancements in data analytics for performance improvement, equipment design, and team member recruitment and selection. We will also briefly discuss how the betting industry has been relaying and developing sports analytics. The second area is Athlete’s Wellness and Wellbeing, which will discuss how wearables and data analytics have been used to assess physical activity and sedentary behavior profiles, sleep and circadian rhythm, nutrition and eating behavior, menstrual cycles, and training/performance readiness. In the final part of this paper, we argue that a critical issue for managers to enhance their decision making is the standardization of acquired information and decision-making processes, while introducing an adaptable, personalized approach. Thus, we present and discuss new theoretical and practical approaches that could potentially address this problem and identify precision medicine as a recommended methodology. This conceptualization involves the integration of pervasive computing and data analytics by employing predictive models that are constantly updated with the outcomes from monitoring tools and athletes’ feedback interventions. This framework has the potential to revolutionize how athletes’ performance and well-being are monitored, assessed, and optimized, contributing to a new era of precision in sports science and medicine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the contemporary era, Kabaddi is considered as a commercial game. Manual analytics were used in old times in which the best team or player was selected based on the background. However, in the present era, statistical analysis and machine learning are used in place of conventional methods of sports analytics in commercial sports such as Cricket, Football, etc. This study intends to analyze correlations for features of accumulated online datasets and to make predictions for the team and player performance using correlated features by using statistical machine learning approaches. The suggested methodology includes feature extraction, correlation identification, and implementing appropriate machine learning approaches. Initially, the parameters of the Kabaddi game concerns such as the impact of tosses, cards, and home ground on results were analysed. Subsequently, based on team and player data correlation and cluster analysis, important characteristics were identified and appropriate rank-based scoring was established. Finally, the regression-based prediction was suggested with an r2 score and a cross-validation score greater than 0.91 with the least errors. Finally, a trained machine-learning model with greater outcomes was suggested by verifying the parameters that were analysed. After the completion of analysis, the proposed techniques would be utilized in real-time scenarios using visual dashboards, deep learning, the Internet of Things, etc. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using automated data analysis to understand what makes a play successful in football can enable teams to make data-driven decisions that may enhance their performance throughout the season. Analyzing different types of plays (e.g., corner, penalty, free kicks) requires different considerations. This work focuses on the analysis of corner kick plays. However, the central ideas apply to analyzing all types of plays. While prior analyses (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) have explored the link between contextual factors (e.g., match period, type of defensive marking) and the level of success of a corner kick (e.g., shot, shot on goal, goal), there has been no attempt to combine spatiotemporal event data (sequences of ball movements through the field) and contextual information to determine when and how (strategy) a particular type of corner kick play (tactic) is more likely to succeed or not. To address this gap, we propose an approach that (1) transforms spatiotemporal data into an alternative representation suitable for mining sequential patterns, (2) identifies and characterizes the sequential patterns used by offensive teams to move the ball toward the scoring zone (tactics), and (3) extracts contrast patterns to identify under what conditions different tactics result in increased chances of success or failure; we call these conditions strategies. Our results suggest that favorable and unfavorable conditions for tactic application are not the same across different tactics, supporting the argument that there is a benefit in performing an analysis that treats different tactics separately, where spatiotemporal information plays a crucial role. Unlike prior works on the corner kick, our approach can capture how the interaction between multiple contextual factors impacts the outcome of a corner kick. At the same time, the results can be explained to others in natural languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The work attempts to provide more precise and timely forecasts, which are crucial for efficient sports analytics, by utilizing the spatial nuances seen in athlete score photographs. We compiled a diverse collection of annotated athlete score photos from several sports settings in an effort to achieve real-time athlete score prediction. We designed an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, and adapted it for the extraction of spatial features. The Convolution Neural Network was carefully trained with the Adam optimisation method, and its accuracy and loss metrics were continuously monitored. A comprehensive comparison study utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) evaluated important performance metrics such as precision, computational effectiveness, and instantaneous inference capabilities. Convolution Neural Network is a powerful tool for improving real-time sports analytics. This was demonstrated by the integration of the trained Convolution Neural Network model into a real-time athlete scoring system, which involved optimizing processing pipelines for low-latency performance without sacrificing prediction accuracy. The Convolution Neural Network based feature extraction technique has better accuracy of 89.28% than the Recurrent Neural Network with 79.41 %.

	abstract = {The National Basketball Association (NBA) values regular-season success and acknowledges the crucial role of a team's roster composition in determining overall performance. This study uses machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning clustering and decision tree models, to predict the composition of a winning roster. Our research identified three distinct clusters based on win percentage and the distribution of players across different skill levels. Successful teams typically have more top-tier players and a significant representation of players in the lowest skill level. In contrast, teams that spread their talent across the entire roster are less successful. We have noticed that players with average to above-average skills are notably affected by excessive playing time in the previous game, which leads to decreased performance and potential losses for the team in the next game. Considering the time of year and the gap between games, we recommend prioritizing the rest and recovery of top players, especially in the latter half of the season. It's crucial to ensure that players who are not as skilled as the top players but still make significant contributions to the team maintain consistent performance, especially during the first half of the season. Analyzing height's impact on basketball player performance has revealed practical insights that can empower coaches and management. We found that the shortest and tallest players often perform less than those of average height. Most top performers in the NBA tend to have heights closer to the average. However, for players who frequently operate near the net and encounter numerous rebound opportunities, it is generally preferable to have an average or taller player for slightly enhanced overall performance compared to below-average height players. Teams can use these insights to improve their roster construction and maximize player utilization by coaches from one game to the next. This research provides practical strategies that can be immediately implemented to enhance team performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In order to identify areas for improvement and potential injury risks, this proposed work aims to utilize the potential of AI techniques, such as XGBoost, to evaluate extensive player data, including movement patterns, biomechanics, and physical condition. This strategy is unusual because it combines real-time feedback systems with AI-powered predictive modeling to offer athletes and coaches individualized training advice and early warnings about potential injury risks. Cleaning and normalization were done during the preparation phase to make sure the data was suitable for analysis. Utilizing XGBoost for feature extraction allowed for the identification of critical factors affecting efficiency and injury risk. In sports analytics, the suggested XGBoost-AI system was compared to other AI-based techniques for improving performance and avoiding injuries. The study's findings show that the XGBoost classifier significantly improves performance accuracy, which may reach 96%. This is in contrast to conventional approaches that depend on subjective evaluations and human data analysis, which can result in errors and inefficiencies.

	abstract = {Data analytics converts raw data into actionable insights. Sports analytics is pivotal in developing strategies and preparing players to achieve their best performance. It is especially important for team sports. However, gathering game data from previous game video recordings for sport analytics is time-consuming and tedious for coaches and their assistants. It could take them hours or days to sift through video clips to gather relevant information to prepare for their next game. This manual process called”tagging” in American football is essential to game planning for coaches. Automating this manual process can provide great benefits for teams in reducing the effort for data gathering and increasing the time for practice. Particularly, being able to automatically classify the offensive play formation for each play is crucial for developing game plans. This paper reports on our feasibility study on using machine learning techniques to automate the manual process. We studied offensive play formations extensively and devised an data augmentation strategy to generate realistic data for training and testing of our neural network. Using these synthetic data for training and testing, our neural network achieves an accuracy of 100% in recognizing 25 commonly used play formations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global appeal of football is fueled by its exhilarating dynamic and unpredictable nature. Football match prediction is still a challenging issue due to its growing interest. The accurate prediction of football match outcomes has been a topic of significant interest for various stakeholders, including coaches, analysts, and fans. This study explored the use of dimensionality reduction methods and different machine learning models to predict the results of football matches. A historical dataset was created from La Liga matches spanning four seasons, incorporating both technical and tactical actions for each match and both teams, comprising 297 features per match. Most important attributes are chosen from the feature set using various feature selection techniques including Pearson Correlation, Spearman's Rank Correlation, ANOVA F Test, and Random Forest. For prediction, a variety of classification techniques including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are used. The combination of the ANOVA F Test feature selection technique and the Random Forest classification method outperformed other models achieving an accuracy of 64.78% with 22 selected features when applied to an independent test set. This paper advances the field of match result prediction research by demonstrating how several machine learning classifiers and dimensionality reduction approaches can accurately predict the outcome of a football match. The suggested methodology can be expanded to other sports or high-dimensional data domains, and it has potential applications in sports analytics and team management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this study is to develop a method for predicting game outcomes during an ODI cricket competition. Like all other papers, we adopted the factor-based prediction meaning the prediction will depend on various game factors like wickets left, overs left, current run, run rate, etc. Sometimes the models can not make good predictions based on these factors and we tried to improve that by adding weight to overs and wickets because these two vastly control the score of the game. We named this feature the resource factor. We used linear regression, polynomial regression, elastic net regression, Xgboost, and random forest and found that random forest works best for our dataset. For more interaction, we used a web application and we applied our best model to predict the score. For the test phase, the R<sup>2</sup> score for the random forest regressor is 0.9899 which is pretty good, and for the MAE and MSE scores, we have got 3.3569 and 37.3555. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Effective and data-driven training can reduce injury related to over-exertion and boost player performance. Shooting is a crucial skill in soccer and can significantly influence the outcome of a game. This work addresses the lack of a smart and privacy-aware device to track and analyze players' shot localization accuracy, particularly for amateur players. We investigate a smart soccer net that can localize the point of impact of the ball from the perturbations of small inertial measuring sensors attached to the net. We train a feedforward neural network with raw data and statistical-based features, and a convolutional neural network with time- and frequency-based features from continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Also, we investigated one, two, three, and four sensors deployed in selected configurations on the net. Four sensors deployed in a rhombus configuration and a model trained with CWT-based features achieved the best classification accuracy of 94 %. A cost-effective option of using three sensors in an inverted triangle configuration and the model trained with statistical-based features achieved 90 % accuracy. This work is a step towards a minimalistic system that can be used as a training aid to automatically track the positions of soccer player shots in the goal during training sessions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Incredible progress has been made in human action recognition (HAR), significantly impacting computer vision applications in sports analytics. However, identifying dynamic and complex movements in sports like badminton remains challenging due to the need for precise recognition accuracy and better management of complex motion patterns. Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) improve recognition in large datasets, while the traditional machine learning methods like SVM (support vector machines), RF (random forest), and LR (logistic regression), combined with handcrafted features and ensemble approaches, perform well but struggle with the complexity of fast-paced sports like badminton. We proposed an ensemble learning model combining support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) for badminton action recognition. The data in this study consist of video recordings of badminton stroke techniques, which have been extracted into spatiotemporal data. The three-dimensional distance between each skeleton point and the right hip represents the spatial features. The temporal features are the results of Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FDTW) calculations applied to 15 frames of each video sequence. The weighted ensemble model employs soft voting classifiers from SVM, LR, RF, and AdaBoost to enhance the accuracy of badminton action recognition.

	abstract = {This paper provides an original FL CNN framework specially designed for categorizing serve shots in table tennis. The approach deals with data security protection and stability challenges in the model. Standard pattern recognition methods typically require the collection of data to be centralized, which is quite problematic in terms of privacy and limits the number of available datasets. The FL method is applied as a collaborative approach to training models with distributed datasets where privacy is maintained while the set datasets are augmented to improve the resulting model. Comparison was also made of the FL CNN architecture with that of a conventional centralized structure. The FL model reached a classification accuracy of 92.5%, Precision of 93.2%, and Recall of 91. 8%, and the F1-score was equal to 92. 5%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the centralized model I achieved was 89. 70% for centrepiece agreement and a precision rate of 90. 5%, a recall rate of 88.Therefore, the percentage increases by 5%, and the median and metamorphotic increases by 19%. Specifically, it achieves an accuracy of 92%, Precision of 94%, Recall of 93% and F1-score of 89.3%. The study shows that the FL technique effectively controls many serve shots, and data privacy is well protected. The investigation of training loss revealed that the FL model had a lessened training loss compared to the centralized model over 20 epochs of training. The training losses in the FL model and the centralized model were 0 at the end, 22 and 18, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study presents an advanced approach to tackle prediction by considering comprehensive player and game data. This study proposes a hybrid modeling framework that integrates feature engineering with machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Neural Networks, to enhance the accuracy of tackle predictions. Our methodology begins with extensive preprocessing of the dataset, standardizing date formats, handling missing data, and transforming key variables such as player height and weight into more meaningful features like Body Mass Index (BMI). The integration of domain-specific features, including player age, position, and game-related statistics, allows for a more detailed understanding of the factors influencing tackle outcomes. Here, the models are trained and evaluated by using a rigorous train-test split and cross-validation approach, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving superior accuracy and predictive power. Through the use of confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analyses, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. This research highlights the potential of combining traditional machine learning methods with deep learning techniques to capture the complex dynamics of football.

This system can identify deviations from regular patterns, provide alerts, and ensure safety in case of emergencies or potential risks. These solutions enhance quality of life by promoting independent living while offering peace of mind to loved ones and caregivers. Visual impairments have become the chief part of these problems over the past few years. Usually, visually impaired people seek help from others to keep doing their daily tasks. An automated human activity recognition (HAR) technique could enhance a vision-impaired person's transaction activity and safe movement. HAR using deep learning (DL) includes training neural networks to automatically detect and classify various activities carried out by humans based on sensor information. By leveraging DL approaches, the HAR system could accurately identify and classify activities, including sitting, standing, walking, or running, from the information captured by sensors or wearable devices. This system is integral to smart home automation, healthcare, and sports analytics. This study develops an Automated Fractal Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm with Machine Learning based HAR (QSSA-MLHAR) for assisting elderly and visually impaired people. The QSSA-MLHAR technique uses sensory input data to identify human activities in diverse classes. In the QSSA-MLHAR technique, the min-max scalar is primarily used to scale the input data. Besides, the QSSA-MLHAR technique applies a mixed extreme learning machine (M-ELM) model to classify various human actions. The QSSA-based hyperparameter tuning process is used to improve the detection results of the M-ELM system. A wide range of simulations was performed to ensure the better performance of the QSSA-MLHAR method. The comprehensive outcomes assured that the QSSA-MLHAR technique performs well compared to other models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Active player tracking in sports analytics is crucial for understanding team dynamics, player performance, and game strategies. This paper introduces an innovative approach to tracking active players in handball videos using a fusion of the Multi-Deep SORT algorithm and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The novel integration aims to enhance player appearance for robust and precise tracking in dynamic gameplay. The system starts with a GAN model trained on annotated handball video data, generating synthetic frames to improve the visual quality and realism of player appearances, thereby refining the input data for tracking. The Multi-Deep SORT algorithm, enhanced with GAN-generated features, improves object association and continuous player tracking. This framework addresses key challenges in active player tracking, handling occlusions, variations in player appearances, and complex interactions. Additionally, GAN-based enhancements improve accuracy in distinguishing active from inactive players, facilitating precise localization and recognition. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's efficacy in achieving high tracking accuracy, robustness, and differentiation between player activity levels. Metrics such as Average Precision (AP), Average Recall (AR), accuracy, and F1-score affirm the system's advancement in active player tracking. This pioneering fusion of Multi-Deep SORT with GAN-based player appearance enhancement sets a new standard for precise, robust, and context-aware active player tracking in handball videos. It offers comprehensive insights for coaches, analysts, and players to optimize team strategies and performance. This paper highlights the novel integration's advancements and benefits in the domain of sports analytics.

Coaches rely on analytics to scout opponents and optimize play calls in gameplay. With the advancement in artificial intelligence, accessible and in-depth data collection has been enabled. The well-grounded technique for performance evaluation in sports analytics is Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Our focus is on real-time action recognition in combat sports like boxing. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are heavily parameterized, so can’t be used in real-time in any low-end devices. Apart from this, fine-grained classification in highly dynamic activities in sports are typically performed using sensors only. Our proposed Machine Learning based pipeline provides real-time fine-grained solution for 14 boxing punch types of classification using RGB video only. Our approach includes the implementation of three novel and generalized motion dynamics features that encode velocity as well as acceleration of the pose sequences., 1) Unified-Axis Angular Encoding (UAE), 2) 2D Motion Dynamics Descriptors (2DMDD), 3) Fifth-order Angular Encoding (FAE). We employed classical machine learning algorithms I.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to make a lightweight model and test it on YouTube videos. The average accuracies of pipeline using the proposed features are found to be 55%, 92% and 84% for UAE, 2DMDD, and FAE respectively. Using KNN, we have achieved 99% accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation by using FAE features. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The emergence of data-driven analytics and intelligent monitoring systems is radically transforming the world of competitive sports. However, robust real-time activity recognition remains elusive for rapid-paced sports like table tennis due to the complexity of strokes and quick maneuvering. This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization. Our proposed model outperformed the latest models in this field with higher accuracy, recall values, F1-score, and precision. While expanding the dataset diversity and testing variations of deep network architectures could further enhance performance, this paper demonstrates a crucial leap toward helping real-time analytics in table tennis using an AI-powered computer vision approach. The hybrid system combining IoT, wearables, and machine learning establishes a framework to transform data into actionable and timely insights for table tennis players and coaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Determining key performance indicators and classifying players accurately between competitive levels is one of the classification challenges in sports analytics. A recent study applied Random Forest algorithm to identify important variables to classify rugby league players into academy and senior levels and achieved 82.0% and 67.5% accuracy for backs and forwards. However, the classification accuracy could be improved due to limitations in the existing method. Therefore, this study aimed to introduce and implement feature selection technique to identify key performance indicators in rugby league positional groups and assess the performances of six classification algorithms. Fifteen and fourteen of 157 performance indicators for backs and forwards were identified respectively as key performance indicators by the correlation-based feature selection method, with seven common indicators between the positional groups. Classification results show that models developed using the key performance indicators had improved performance for both positional groups than models developed using all performance indicators. 5-Nearest Neighbour produced the best classification accuracy for backs and forwards (accuracy = 85% and 77%) which is higher than the previous method’s accuracies. When analysing classification questions in sport science, researchers are encouraged to evaluate multiple classification algorithms and a feature selection method should be considered for identifying key variables. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Consequently, being a multi-format and multi-variable game, cricket raises a lot of challenges in respect to making a perfect prediction of the match. The paper proposes a new deep learning-based prediction approach for One Day International (ODI) cricket, using Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with an attention mechanism. While traditional machine learning-based models have shown some promise, they still suffer from the inability to capture long-term dependencies within a cricket match sequential data. The LSTM architecture inherently tends to learn these temporal patterns really well; hence, it is particularly suited for this task. The attention mechanism further enhances this model, where the critical moments in the match are solely responsible for the outcome. Based on this, detection will be done with an extensive dataset covering more than matches of various cricket formats: ODI, T20I, and Test matches. The dataset is a collection from ESPNcricinfo and other official cricket databases, including ball-by-ball information with relevant contextual features: performance metrics from teams, player statistics, weather conditions, and venue information. With this great performance, it was much higher than the best performance of traditional machine learning approaches by as high as 94%. This work provides new insights into applying deep learning to sports analytics and opens up more possibilities toward innovation in predicting the results of cricket matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There has been a noticeable upsurge in the amount of research conducted in the last several years on the analysis of human behavior, especially among computer vision experts. Technological developments and the growing uses of human activity recognition (HAR) in various industries, including healthcare, sports analytics, and human-computer interface, are responsible for the growing interest. Deep learning techniques are the most promising of the different approaches to HAR because of their capacity to extract intricate patterns from enormous datasets. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing human activities utilizing 3D skeleton information. A wide range of human movements can be accurately recognized and categorized using this method, which makes use of deep learning's capabilities. The center parts of our approach are illustrated as Joint Position Scaling and Temporal Alignment. After normalization, the 3D skeleton data is represented in two different forms like Spatial Representation and Temporal Representation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been employed on the features extracted from the deep neural network to improve our model's classification accuracy. The output from the second last layer of the neural network is used to train the SVM, allowing it to draw a decision boundary that effectively divides movements of gait. Bayesian Optimization technique has been used to adjust each hyperparameter to make sure our model was resilient. This approach is very useful as it finds the best configurations by quickly exploring the hyperparameter space. The PKU-MMD dataset, which offered a thorough baseline for our model's training, was used for the optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study used a novel machine learning approach to uncover key serve variables that maximize effectiveness in men’s professional doubles tennis. A large dataset of 14,146 serves from 97 Davis Cup doubles matches played between 2010 and 2019 was analyzed using explainable AI techniques. The angle and distance from the bounce to the sidelines of the serves were found to best distinguish the points won with aces from rallies lasting more than three strokes. Optimal serve angle ranges of 5.7–8.7° substantially increased the probability of serving an ace by over 80%, compared to around 30% when serving used more central angles. Lateral bounce distances of 0–28 cm from the sidelines also boosted the ace probability by over 50%. The serve speed was shown to have less influence on serve effectiveness as compared to singles tennis, with velocities above 187 km h<sup>−1</sup> only increasing the probability of serving an ace by 10%. These findings have important practical implications for the tactical decision-making and technical training of serves in men’s professional doubles tennis. The data highlight that the angle and placement of serves are more important than velocity for attaining effective serves in doubles. Coaches and players can use this knowledge to pay special attention to the most important variables in the effectiveness of serves, such as the line distance and angle, in order to maximize the performance of the doubles serve. The novel methodology used in this study provides a valid and reliable way to calculate the efficiency of actions in various sport disciplines using tracking data and machine learning approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For the analysis, data were collected from 812 completed matches played between 2008 and 2020. Initially, several candidate features were identified, and then the LASSO method was applied as a feature selection technique to identify the most important set of features. Based on the identified important features, predictions are provided for each stage of a match where a T20 match can consist of a maximum of 240 stages. For each stage, three classification models were formed using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. The prediction accuracy was used for evaluating the findings of the study, and the prediction accuracy of each model indicates the ratio between the number of correctly predicted instances and the total number of predicted instances. Naive Bayes demonstrated prediction accuracies ranging from 53.08% to 91.76% between the first and the 240th stage of matches, whereas the accuracy of Logistic Regression varied from 56.92% to 97.65%. In comparison, Support Vector Machines also displayed comparable outcomes with a prediction accuracy of 55.00% at the first stage, and 90.59% at the 240th stage. Furthermore, a strategy generator that assists the competing teams in the second innings to devise winning strategies, is presented in this study alongside an interactive web-based application for making in-game predictions, and for assisting the end users (players and coaching/managing staff) in decision making, based on the generated winning strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the sports industry has witnessed a significant rise in interest in leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance players' performance. However, the application of deep learning to improve badminton athletes' performance faces challenges related to identifying weaknesses, generating winning suggestions, and validating strategy effectiveness. These challenges arise due to the limited availability of realistic environments and agents. This paper aims to address these research gaps and make contributions to the badminton community. To achieve this goal, we propose a closed-loop approach consisting of six key components: Badminton Data Acquisition, Imitating Players' Styles, Simulating Matches, Optimizing Strategies, Training Execution, and Real-World Competitions. Specifically, we developed a novel model called RallyNet, which excels at imitating players' styles, allowing agents to accurately replicate real players' behavior. Secondly, we created a sophisticated badminton simulation environment that incorporates real-world physics, faithfully recreating game situations. Thirdly, we employed reinforcement learning techniques to improve players' strategies, enhancing their chances of winning while preserving their unique playing styles. By comparing strategy differences before and after improvement, we provide winning suggestions to players, which can be validated against diverse opponents within our carefully designed environment. Lastly, through collaborations with badminton venues and players, we apply the generated suggestions to the players' training and competitions, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we continuously gather data from training and competitions, incorporating it into the closed-loop cycle to refine strategies and suggestions. This research presents an innovative approach for continuously improving players' performance, contributing to the field of AI-driven sports performance enhancement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics have benefited immensely from the growth and popularity of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These techniques enable sports analysts to evaluate player performance more effectively. A literature review of player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A novel framework was proposed to evaluate batsman strength based on individual performance, role in the team, and team interactions. Traditionally, proposed ranking systems are derived from static networks, that is, the aggregation of game results over time. However, the scores of the players (or teams) fluctuate over time. Intuitively, defeating a renowned player during peak performance is more rewarding than defeating the same player during other periods. To account for this, we propose a new method and apply it to the T20 format Indian Premier League. The method serves three main purposes: First, it creates a new performance index for players to rank them more accurately and effectively. Second, the players are clustered based on their expertise. In the third phase, a social network analysis approach is applied to visualize and analyze crickets as a network to gain better insights into players’ team interactions. This novel approach is a helpful index for sports coaches, analysts, cricket fans, and managers to evaluate player performance and rank for future aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As artificial intelligence spreads out to numerous fields, the application of AI to sports analytics is also in the spotlight. However, one of the major challenges is the difficulty of automated acquisition of continuous movement data during sports matches. In particular, it is a conundrum to reliably track a tiny ball on a wide soccer pitch with obstacles such as occlusion and imitations. Tackling the problem, this paper proposes an inference framework of ball trajectory from player trajectories as a cost-efficient alternative to ball tracking. We combine Set Transformers to get permutation-invariant and equivariant representations of the multi-agent contexts with a hierarchical architecture that intermediately predicts the player ball possession to support the final trajectory inference. Also, we introduce the reality loss term and postprocessing to secure the estimated trajectories to be physically realistic. The experimental results show that our model provides natural and accurate trajectories as well as admissible player ball possession at the same time. Lastly, we suggest several practical applications of our framework including missing trajectory imputation, semi-automated pass annotation, automated zoom-in for match broadcasting, and calculating possession-wise running performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Creativity is highly valued in soccer players. It contributes to exciting and unpredictable play, which can help teams to overcome defensive strategies and create scoring opportunities. Consequently, evaluating the creative abilities of players is an important aspect of the player recruitment process. However, there is currently no clear way to measure creativity in soccer. It is not captured by the typical result-based performance indicators, as being creative entails going beyond just doing something useful, to accomplishing something useful but in a unique or atypical way. Therefore in this paper, we define a novel metric to quantify the level of creativity involved in a player's passes. Our Creative Decision Rating (CDR) utilizes machine learning techniques to assess two important factors: the originality of a pass, and its value in terms of increasing the team's chances of scoring a goal. We validated our metric on StatsBomb 360 contextual event stream data of the 2021/22 English Premier League season and show through a number of use cases that it provides another angle on a player's skill, complementing existing player evaluation metrics. Overall, our metric provides a concise method for capturing and quantifying the creativity of soccer players and could have important implications for player recruitment and talent development in the sport. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the recent progress in sports analytics, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of mining insights into players' tactics for improving performance quality and fan engagement. This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and women's singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players' tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics has captured increasing attention since analysis of the various data enables insights for training strategies, player evaluation, etc. In this paper, we focus on predicting what types of returning strokes will be made, and where players will move to based on previous strokes. As this problem has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing work on representing strategic relations among players’ shot types and movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion for Movement Forecasting model (DyMF) with interaction style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and between both players within a rally, and dynamic players’ tactics across time. In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods and demonstrate the practical usage of movement forecasting.

	abstract = {One of the significant challenges in the sports industry is identifying the factors influencing match results and their respective weightage. For appropriate recommendations to the team management and the team players, there is a need to predict the match and quantify the important factors for which prediction models need to be developed. The second thing required is identifying talented and emerging players and performing an associative analysis of the important factors to the match-winning outcome. This paper formulates a hybrid machine learning-clustering-associative rules model. This paper also implements the framework for cricket matches, one of the most popular sports globally watched by billions around the world. We predict the match outcome for One day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty 20 s (T20s) (two formats of Cricket representing fifty over and twenty over versions respectively) adopting state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep neural networks. The variable importance is computed using machine-learning techniques and further statistically validated through the regression model. The emerging talented players are identified by clustering. Association rules are generated for determining the best possible winning outcome. The results show that environmental conditions are equally crucial for determining a match result, as are internal quantitative factors. The model is thus helpful for both team management and for players to improve their winning strategy and also for discovering emerging players to form an unbeatable team. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However, converting the sensor information to 3-D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Toward solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), encoder-decoder networks, and ResNets to extract 3-D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3-D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. In addition, this article validates the feasibility of mirrored bilateral training approach with applications in prosthetic devices. Finally, NeuroPose is comprehensively evaluated on both low-end and recent smartphones with a processing latency of 0.019 s and low energy overhead. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs, an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance. The theoretical findings and the proposed method provide insights and a strong methodological alternative for all classification, prediction or pattern recognition applications in the areas of collective movement analysis, automated match analysis, and performance analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cricket is a popular sport with complex gameplay and numerous variables that contribute to team performance. In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, aiming to extract valuable insights from large volumes of cricket data. Cricket has many fans in India. With a strong fan following, many try to use their cricket intuition to predict the outcome of a match. A set of rules and a points system govern the game. The venue and the performance of each player greatly affect the outcome of the match. The game is difficult to predict accurately as the various components are closely related. The CRR (Current Run Rate) approach is used to predict the final score of the first innings of a cricket match. Total points are calculated by multiplying the average number of runs scored in each over by the total number of overs. For ODI cricket, these methods are useless as the game can change very quickly regardless of the current run rate. The game may be decided by 1 or 2 overs. For more accurate score predictions, a system is needed that can more accurately predict the outcome of an inning. This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict scores and classify players based on their roles in the squad. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of cricket matches, including player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest regression models are employed to predict scores. Additionally, player categorization is performed using a classification approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in enhancing performance analysis and decision-making in the game of cricket. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, particularly in the area of using machine learning techniques to analyze athlete performance and injury risks. This paper focuses on the use of machine learning for predicting injuries in football players and proposes a concept for an intelligent system that can provide early warnings of potential injuries. To achieve this, the proposed intelligent system will gather input from various sources such as athlete performance data, muscle strength assessments, and DNA markers. Using this information, the system will employ machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict the probability of injury occurrence. The intelligent system will offer coaches and medical staff actionable insights to help them take preventative measures and decrease the likelihood of injuries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports predictions has gained popularity as a topic of study thanks to the development of sports analytics and the accessibility of extensive and sophisticated match data. In this paper, a machine learning-based (ML) strategy for forecasting football match results is presented. In the past, the number of goals scored by each team in a football (FB) game served as a benchmark for assessing a team's performance and projecting future outcomes to forecast the results of football games, such as win, draw, or defeat. However, there are significant discrepancies between a team's performance and the number of goals scored or conceded throughout many games because the number of goals scored during a match contains a significant random element.The goal of this study is to create an accurate and dependable prediction model that will help fans, analysts, and bet enthusiasts make wise selections. The selection of features, treatment of data that is imbalanced and the generalization of models constitute significant issues that are addressed in this paper. The system learns patterns from previous encounters and player attributes to develop predictions for upcoming games. Various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and regression, are experimented with. The main goal of this research is to investigate various Machine Learning techniques to forecast football game results utilizing in-game match events and individual and team statistics off the field.As football remains a globally popular sport, the integration of machine learning for match prediction offers an exciting avenue for enthusiasts to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of the game. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, a key question that arises from using mapper graphs across applications is how to compare mapper graphs to study their structural differences. In this paper, we introduce a distance between mapper graphs using tools from optimal transport. We demonstrate the utility of such a distance by studying the topological changes of neural activations across convolutional layers in deep learning, as well as by capturing the loss of structural information for a multiscale mapper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The field of quantitative analytics has transformed the world of sports over the last decade. To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters, it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the 2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress in deep learning-based computer vision has opened unprecedented possibilities in computing various high-level analytics for sports. Artificial intelligence techniques such as predictive analysis, automatic highlight generation, and assistant coaching have been applied to improve performance and decision-making for teams and players. To perform any high-level analysis from a game match, collecting the locations (where) and identities (who) of players is crucial and challenging. In this paper, a universal JErsey number DEtector (JEDE) for player identification is presented that predicts players' bounding boxes and keypoints, along with bounding boxes and classes of jersey digits and numbers in an end-to-end manner. Instead of generating digit proposals from pre-defined anchors, JEDE predicts more robust proposals guided by players' features and pose estimation. Moreover, a dataset is collected from soccer and basketball matches with annotations on players' bounding boxes and body keypoints, and jersey digits' bounding boxes and labels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the collected dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Both quantitative and qualitative results also demonstrate JEDE's superior practicality and generalizability over different sports. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Such applications not only play an important role during matches but also have a great influence on the training stage. However, applying deep learning techniques to sports analytics has several technical challenges, which also remain untouched in badminton analytics as there is no public dataset of stroke event records. Therefore, this dissertation intends to explore challenging research questions and application issues that have not been addressed for benefiting both the research and badminton communities. To achieve the objectives, we, for the first time, propose a unified badminton language to describe the process of the shot, which enables us to conduct downstream applications. Specifically, our first task is to measure the win probability of each shot in badminton matches by considering long-term and short-term dependencies. Second, we introduce a framework with two encoder-decoder extractors and a position-aware fusion network to forecast the possible tactics of players, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. To provide the transparency of these models, we aim to design a post-hoc explainer by computing feature attributions with Shapley values as the third task. In this manner, researchers can investigate model behaviors for advanced improvement, and the badminton community benefits from coaching the players and determining the strategies.

One important task in this context is the performance measurement of individual players to provide reports and log files for subsequent analysis. During sport events like basketball, this involves the re-identification of players during a match either from multiple camera viewpoints or from a single camera viewpoint at different times. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the out-standing zero-shot performance of pre-Trained CLIP models to the domain of player re-identification. For this purpose we reformulate the contrastive language-To-image pre-Training approach from CLIP to a contrastive image-To-image training approach using the InfoNCE loss as training objective. Unlike previous work, our approach is entirely class-Agnostic and benefits from large-scale pre-Training. With a fine-Tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 model we achieve 98.44% mAP on the MMSports 2022 Player Re-Identification challenge. Furthermore we show that the CLIP Vision Transformers have already strong OCR capabilities to identify useful player features like shirt numbers in a zero-shot manner without any fine-Tuning on the dataset. By applying the Score-CAM algorithm we visualise the most important image regions that our fine-Tuned model identifies when calculating the similarity score between two images of a player. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Goal: This paper presents an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) system to analyze and train Executive Functions (EFs) of soccer players. EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Firstly, we provide a literature based overview of AI success stories in areas other than sports. We identified multiple approaches in the area of Machine Perception, Machine Learning and Modeling, Planning and Optimization as well as Interaction and Intervention, holding a potential for improving training and competition. Secondly, we discover the present status of AI use in elite sports. Therefore, in addition to another literature review, we interviewed leading sports scientist, which are closely connected to the main national service institute for elite sports in their countries. The analysis of this literature review and the interviews show that the most activity is carried out in the methodical categories of signal and image processing. However, projects in the field of modeling & planning have become increasingly popular within the last years. Based on these two perspectives, we extract deficits, issues and opportunities and summarize them in six key challenges faced by the sports analytics community.

Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-Time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion. Extensive evaluation with 12 users depicts a 3D joint angle tracking accuracy of 9.07° (joint position accuracy of 6.55mm) with robustness to natural variation in sensor positions, wrist motion, etc, with low overhead in latency and power consumption on embedded platforms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the more popular cricket world tournaments, and its financial is increasing each season, its viewership has increased markedly and the betting market for IPL is growing significantly every year. With cricket being a very dynamic game, bettors and bookies are incentivised to bet on the match results because it is a game that changes ball-by-ball. This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Performing analytics tasks over large-scale video datasets is increasingly common in a wide range of applications, from traffic planning to sports analytics. These tasks generally involve object detection and tracking operations that require pre-processing the video through expensive machine learning models. To address this cost, several video query optimizers have recently been proposed. Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies. We compare OTIF against three recent video query optimizers, as well as several general-purpose object detection and tracking techniques, and find that, across multiple datasets, OTIF provides a 6x to 25x average reduction in the overall cost to execute five queries over the same video. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cricket is among the most widely practiced and loved team sports worldwide. Machine learning algorithms are having a significant impact on sports analytics and cricket is one of them. By using machine learning techniques, we can create new methodologies, predict player performance and select a team for the next matches or series by predicting player performance. The proposed model is made out of statistical information from reputable sports sources and websites on the best ODI players for the Indian national cricket team. The performance of the players depends on various factors such as the opposition team, the venue, and the number of balls faced by the batsman. This paper makes an attempt to forecast the performance of batsmen based on several features. The main motive behind this study is to predict batsmen performance based on available data using different Regression models like Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DT), Random Forest (RF) Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and evaluate which model is best for the prediction of different batsmen performance. Over the past few years, Fantasy sports have experienced tremendous growth, with a burgeoning fan base. Participants in fantasy sports can assemble fictitious teams from actual players. This project was motivated by the desire to assist selectors in predicting and identifying players who would do well in upcoming ODI series as well as provide sports fans with a pleasant way to interact with statistics and assist them in building their ideal teams on fantasy sports using our model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {During the last few years, sports analytics has been growing rapidly. The main usage of this discipline is the prediction of soccer match results, even if it can be applied with interesting results in different areas, such as analysis based on the player position information. In this paper, the authors propose an approach aimed to recognize the player position in a soccer match, predicting the specific zone in which the player is located in a specific moment. Similar objectives have not yet been considered. The authors consider supervised machine learning techniques by considering a dataset obtained through video capturing and tracking system. The data analyzed refer to several professional soccer games captured at the Alfheim Stadium in Tromso, Norway. The approach can be used in real time in order to verify if a player is playing according to the guidelines of the coach. In the experimental analysis, three different types of classification have been performed (i.e., three different divisions of the field), reaching the best results with random tree algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Because such data is extremely rich and complicated, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Unfortunately, how to evaluate the use of machine learning in the context of sports remains extremely challenging. On the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the developed indicators themselves, where one is confronted by a lack of labels and small sample sizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate the models themselves, which is complicated by the noisy and non-stationary nature of sports data. In this paper, we highlight the inherent evaluation challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for evaluating both indicators and models. In particular, we highlight how reasoning techniques, such as verification can be used to aid in the evaluation of learned models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Rural schools are limited by environmental constraints, especially the lack of physical education resources verification. Therefore, the allocation and utilization efficiency improvement of rural physical education resources are an important element of rural physical education construction. With the mature development of artificial intelligence technology, it has great potential for application in the field of cultural education. Artificial intelligence technology has the advantages of ease of use, strong self-adaptation, and excellent generalization ability, and it is selected for data processing in this paper. Using artificial intelligence technology, the study of sports informatization to help rural sports development and rational utilization of resources can help rural sports education development, rural sports industry prosperity, rural sports talent revitalization, rural sports governance system improvement, and governance capacity enhancement. The artificial intelligence raindrop algorithm, which can automate the statistics of all relevant factors and derive results based on data fusion, was selected as the core algorithm of this paper. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent algorithm for allocating and improving the efficiency of rural sports teaching resources so as to improve the informatization level of the rural sports industry, promote industrial integration based on local needs, accelerate the "online urban-rural integration"in rural sports education, rural fitness guidance, and rural recreation and medical care, and rely on multiple entities. We will support the new model of sports informatization to empower rural sports teaching development by relying on the collaboration of multiple entities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Passes are by far football’s (soccer) most frequent event, yet surprisingly little meaningful research has been devoted to quantify them. With the increase in availability of so-called positional data, describing the positioning of players and ball at every moment of the game, our work aims to determine the difficulty of every pass by calculating its success probability based on its surrounding circumstances. As most experts will agree, not all passes are of equal difficulty, however, most traditional metrics count them as such. With our work we can quantify how well players can execute passes, assess their risk profile, and even compute completion probabilities for hypothetical passes by combining physical and machine learning models. Our model uses the first 0.4 seconds of a ball trajectory and the movement vectors of all players to predict the intended target of a pass with an accuracy of 93.0 % for successful and 72.0 % for unsuccessful passes much higher than any previously published work. Our extreme gradient boosting model can then quantify the likelihood of a successful pass completion towards the identified target with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.4 %. Finally, we discuss several potential applications, like player scouting or evaluating pass decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This is a very challenging task especially in the case of team sports, among which football is a prominent example. This paper is concerned with uncovering a dangerous bias that is present in most of the approaches proposed in the literature that apply statistical techniques or machine learning models to study the correlation between team performances and match outcome. In particular, we find out that players’ behavior on a time interval is more and more correlated with the match outcome as the 90 minutes elapse. As an extreme example, we show that we can predict the output of a match with high confidence simply by looking at the last 15 minutes of the game. We call this effect elapsing-time bias. We conduct a quantitative analysis that proves the existence of this phenomenon and shows its consequences. We then propose a novel way to address the problem. Namely, we design a new machine learning task that is not affected by elapsing-time bias.

To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Theoretical basis: Resource-based view (RBV) theory (Barney, 1991; Barney and Mackey, 2016; Nagano, 2020) states that a firm’s tangible and intangible resources can represent a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), a long-term competitive advantage that is extremely difficult to duplicate by another firm, when it meets four criteria (i.e. not imitable, are rare, valuable and not substitutable). In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies…. and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology: This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis: MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation. Complexity academic level: The case is written and designed for a graduate-level (MBA) class or an upper-level undergraduate class in areas such as contemporary issues in management, human resource management, talent management, strategic management, sports management and sports marketing. The case is suitable for courses that discuss strategy, talent management, human resource management and brand strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of machine learning on spatio-temporal datasets has generated significant interest in a range of applications, including vehicular traffic modelling and urban planning. One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24Â° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33Â° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Human-activity recognition has gained significant attention recently within the computer vision and machine learning community, due to its applications in diverse fields such as health, entertainment, visual surveillance and sports analytics. An important sub-category of human-activity recognition is group activity recognition (GAR) where a group of individuals is involved in an activity. The main challenge in such recognition tasks is to learn the relationship between a group of individuals in a scene and its evolution over time. Recently, many techniques based on deep networks and graphical models have been proposed for group activity recognition. In this paper, we critically analyze the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for group activity recognition. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the SOTA techniques conducted in the field of group activity recognition and divide the existing literature into different subcategories. We also identify the available datasets and the existing research challenges for GAR. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of exciting applications in augmented reality, sports analytics, rehabilitation-healthcare etc. While finger motion tracking with cameras is very mature, largely due to availability of massive training datasets, there is a dearth of training data for developing robust machine learning (ML) models for wearable IoT devices with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. Towards addressing this problem, this paper presents ZeroNet, a system that shows the feasibility of developing ML models for IMU sensors with zero training overhead. ZeroNet harvests training data from publicly available videos for performing inferences on IMU. The difference in data among video and IMU domains introduces a number of challenges due to differences in sensor-camera coordinate systems, body sizes of users, speed/orientation changes during gesturing, sensor position variations etc. ZeroNet addresses these challenges by systematically extracting motion data from videos and transforming them into acceleration and orientation information measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, data-augmentation techniques are exploited that create synthetic variations in the harvested training data to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the ML models to user diversity. Evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 82.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 94.8% for recognition of 50 finger gestures thus indicating promise. While we have only scratched the surface, we outline a number of interesting possibilities for extending this work in the cross-disciplinary areas of computer vision, machine learning, and wearable IoT for enabling novel applications in finger motion tracking. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence are perceived as significant drivers to improve organizational performance and managerial decision-making. Hiring employees and contract renewals are instances of managerial decision-making problems that can incur high financial costs and long-term impacts on organizational performance. The primary goal of this study is to identify the Major League Baseball (MLB) free agents who are likely to receive a contract. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the design science research paradigm and the cognitive analytics management (CAM) theory to develop the research framework. A dataset on MLB's free agents between 2013 and 2017 was collected. A decision support tool was built using artificial neural networks. Findings: There are clear links between a player's statistical performance and the decision of the player to sign a new offered contract. “Age,” “Wins above Replacement” and “the team on which a player last played” are the most significant factors in determining if a player signs a new contract. Originality/value: This paper applied analytical modeling to personnel decision-making using the design science paradigm and guided by CAM as the kernel theory. The study employed machine learning techniques, producing a model that predicts the probability of free agents signing a new contract. Also, a web-based tool was developed to help decision-makers in baseball front offices so they can determine which available free agents to offer contracts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Each player was characterized according to a set of 52 non-spatiotemporal descriptors including offensive, defensive and build-up variables that were computed from OPTA’s on-ball event records of the matches for 18 national leagues between the 2012 and 2019 seasons. To test whether positions could be identified from the statistical performance of the players, the dimensionality reduction techniques were used. To better understand the differences between the player positions, the most discriminatory variables for each group were obtained as a set of rules discovered by RIPPER, a machine learning algorithm. From the combination of both techniques, we obtained useful conclusions to enhance the performance of players and to identify positions on the field. The study demonstrates the suitability and potential of artificial intelligence to characterize players' positions according to their technical-tactical behaviour, providing valuable information to the professionals of this sport. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Recent advances in data collection and data science have opened up new possibilities for performing a data-driven analysis to support the coach in improving the training programs of the athletes. In this paper, we investigate several methods to do such analysis for professional cyclists. We provide the coach with a framework to predict the Maximum Mean Powers (MMPs) of a cyclist in an upcoming race based on the recently performed training sessions. This way the coach can experiment with several planned alternatives to figure out the best way for preparing the athlete for a race. We conduct multiple prediction models through an extensive analysis of a real dataset collected recently about the performance of professional riders with varying physiologies and temporal performance peaks. We show that the application of the hybrid model using XGBoost and CatBoost has clear advantages. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of our general model can be further increased by filtering according to the mountain stages. We have additionally validated the proposed framework using an openly available real dataset and the results were consistent with those of the collected data. We offer an open source implementation of our proposed framework. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The process of modelling individual player performance using machine learning is a mature task in sports analytics. The most significant challenges in machine learning include class imbalance and high dimensionality problems. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and observed that both the issues have been studied independently. We found that feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of relevant features, while data sampling seeks to make the data more balanced by adding or removing instances. We also found out that efforts have been taken for studying the effect of the joint use of feature selection and balancing techniques. However, the prioritization of the feature selection and sampling is still difficult, and the relationship between them remains unclear. This paper presents a large-scale comparison of characterizing football players into nine positions by using FIFA video game data, whereas most of the previous studies in this field have focused on characterizing players into only three classes according to their positions. The proposed methodology for the study consists of three main steps. In the first step, the sampling technique is applied to deal with class imbalance, while the second step encompasses the feature selection technique, which deals with the high dimensionality problem. The third step combines feature selection and data sampling to deal with both the issues. We made the comparisons based on nine feature selection algorithms and three balancing techniques, and then we evaluated their performance using the random forest classifier. We found that 1) feature selection techniques did not improve the accuracy of the baseline model, 2) balancing techniques improved the accuracy compared to the baseline, and 3) the results showed superiority of the proposed methodology, involving the joint application of resampling and feature selection with data balanced by the random oversampling (ROS) method and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), compared to the results obtained only through the use of a single technique and from the original imbalanced training set. Overall, the proposed methodology improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the methodology provided a significant decrease in the number of features, from 29 to 10 features on average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The commercialization of sport has encouraged players, coaches, and other concerns to use technology to be in better position than r their opponents. In the past, the focus was on improved training techniques for better physical performance. These days, sports analytics identify the patterns in the performance and highlight strengths and weaknesses of potential players. Sports analytics not only predict the performance of players in the near future but it also performs predictive modeling for a particular behavior of a player in the past. The impact of a smart player on the success of a team is always a big question mark before the start of a match. The fans always want to know performance analysis of these superstar players and they always are interested to get to know more about their favorite player and they always have high hopes from their favorite player.

The main objective of this study is to accurately predict cardiovascular disease by comparison among different feature selection algorithms. This study has employed a two-stage feature sub-set retrieving technique to achieve this goal: we first considered three well-established feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded), and then, a feature sub-set was extracted using a Boolean process-based common “True” condition from these three algorithms. To justify the comparative accuracy and define the best predictive analytics, the well-known random forest, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost model have been considered. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been considered as the benchmark for further comparison with all features. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the XGBoost Classifier integrated with the wrapper methods offers precise prediction results for cardiovascular disease. The proposed approach can also be applied in other domains such as sports analytics, bio-informatics, and financial analysis in contrast with healthcare informatics. This empirical study’s novelty is that the common “True” condition–based feature selection and comparison technique is entirely a new phenomenon in medical informatics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of "SportsEd 3.5"for universities and collegiate athletic associations to develop an athlete information system for sports analytics. In addition, the framework aims to define the philosophy that will govern all the stakeholders in the utilization of an athlete's information for flexible decision-making. Players' dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports. Supervised algorithms were used to illustrate the value of data and machine learning models in athletic development programs.

Multimodal datasets are beneficial for solving complex research problems with AI methods. Kayaking technique optimization has been challenging, as there seems to be no gold standard for effective paddling techniques since there are outstanding athletes with profoundly different physical capabilities and kayaking styles. Multimodal analysis can help find the most effective paddling techniques for training and competition based on individuals' abilities. We describe the characteristics of the output power of kayak athletes and Electromyogram (EMG) measurements collected from the most critical muscles, and the relationship between these modalities. We propose metrics (weighted arithmetic mean difference and variability of power output and stroke duration) suitable for discerning athletes based on how efficiently and correctly they perform particular training tasks. Additionally, the described methods (asymmetry, coactivation, muscle intensity-output power) help athletes and coaches in assessing their performance and compare it with others based on their EMG activities. As the next step, we will apply machine-learning approaches on the synchronized dataset we collect with the described methods to reveal desirable EMG and stroke patterns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics is one of the fast-growing applications of machine learning and data mining. The major goal in sport analytics applications is to make informed decisions to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse and predict lineup performance in basketball which may assist the team managers and coaches to make informed decisions. The constant lineup change in basketball games makes it vital to always have the best move ready at every moment of the game. A complex decision-making system is very important for the coaches to navigate their team through a season. This system must make the decisions based on the pros and cons of the teams, past results and lineups, and both teams’ performance under similar situations. To create this system, authors have constructed a signed, directed, and weighted network from the results of all matchups and lineups of the teams in NBA from 2007 to 2019. The proposed approach uses machine learning and graph theory to develop a new metric called Inverse Square Metric and edge-centric multi-view networks to predict the performance of a lineup in a given situation. The edge-centric approach provides a deep analysis of any condition between two teams from 16 different perspectives. The average accuracy achieved by ISM and edge-centric multi-view is 68% and 80%, respectively. In the end, the training and test datasets are chosen from different seasons and results are reasonable compared to the baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Given the recent trend in Data Science (DS) and Sports Analytics, an opportunity has arisen for utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques in sports. This paper reviews background and advanced basketball metrics used in National Basketball Association (NBA) and Euroleague games. The purpose of this paper is to benchmark existing performance analytics used in the literature for evaluating teams and players. Basketball is a sport that requires full set enumeration of parameters in order to understand the game in depth and analyze the strategy and decisions by minimizing unpredictability. This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions. Hence, critical analysis of these metrics are valuable tools for domain experts and decision makers to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Win prediction and performance evaluation are two core subjects in the sport analytics. Traditionally, they are treated separately and studied by two independent communities. However, this is not the intuitive way how humans interpret the matches: we predict the match results with the competition carrying on, and simultaneously evaluate each action based on the game context and its downstream impact. Predicting the match outcomes and evaluating the actions are coupled tasks, and the more accurately we predict, the better the evaluation is To this end, we develop a unified Match Tracing framework (namely, MT), for tackling the win prediction and performance evaluation jointly. The main idea of MT is to learn a real-time look-ahead win rate curve rather than a single scalar (win or lose). And the value of an action can be objectively measured with respect to the increase or decrease of the curve. To meet the low-latency restrictions of the online deployments, an efficient model equipped with recurrent attention mechanism and matrix perturbation (i.e., MT-Net) is built for learning and yielding the win rate curve. MT-Net encodes the players' behavior sequence through an attention mechanism and captures the player-interaction effects through a graph embedding method. With the action values derived from the win rate curve, performance can be quantified at different granularities (action/player/match level) by integrated analysis. Experiments on an e-sport game demonstrate the prediction effectiveness and the feasibility of the MT framework. Furthermore, we present the detailed application cases of MT, including key actions recognition and close match detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Player profile evaluation and player selection play a very important role in any sports and cricket is not an exception to that. In any cricket team, all players can be segregated into two main roles, namely: Batsmen and bowlers. To win a match, a team has to be comprised of the best performing players and such a scenario demands an evaluation of a player profile for team selection. Our study proposes an approach to predict batsman ranking by evaluation of a batsman's past profile. We have used a supervised machine learning technique on past data of Indian Premier League matches to produce a ranking algorithm of batsmen of an ongoing season, which can be used to gauge a batsman's performance, or to compare between different batsmen. The novelty of our approach lies in the consideration of multiple cricketing parameters, instead of only one parameter i.e. total runs scored, to design the algorithm and in the prediction of top batsmen. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A three-way between-subjects analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effects of model, input features and target behavior on classification accuracy. Results show significant differences in classification accuracy between models as well as significant interaction effects between factors. Our models achieve classification performance similar to previous work in other sports.

	abstract = {This paper adopts STEAMS (Science, Technology, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Math, Statistics) methodology. The objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements, especially living in the Big Data World. The NBA Draft Position case study was demonstrated to present this novel “STEAMS” concept as compared to the current “STEM” or” STEAM” approach. There are three core visions of this “STEAMS” methodology: (1) replace “Art” with “Artificial Intelligence”, (2) separate “Statistics” from “Math”, and (3) integrate all six “STEAMS” elements. Adding the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions. Due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements is becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern Big Data era. Several techniques are used to help determine the NBA Player position and identify the similar NBA players for the benchmarking objective. It’s critical and urgent for educators and teachers to abandon the traditional STEM approach to adopt the new “STEAMS” approach to educate our next generations in their early school learning and career development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Then, box scores and four factors have been used as classification independent variables, to predict the winner of matches involving the Golden State Warriors team. Both CART and Random Forests machine learning techniques have been applied, and quality of fitting analyzed. Variable importance of fitted models has been studied to identify success drivers showing how, for Golden State Warriors, defense is a key factor to win a game.

	abstract = {The use of machine learning to identify and classify offensive and defensive strategies in team sports through spatio-temporal tracking data has received significant interest recently in the literature and the global sport industry. This paper focuses on data-driven defensive strategy learning in basketball. Most research to date on basketball strategylearning has focused on offensive effectiveness and is based on the interaction between the on-ball player and principleon-ball defender, thereby ignoring the contribution of the remaining players. Furthermore, most sports analytical systems that provide play-by-play data is heavily biased towards offensive metrics such as passes, dribbles, and shots. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning to classify the different defensive strategies basketball players adopt when deviating from their initial defensive action. An analytical model was developed to recognise the one-on-one (matched) relationships of the players, which is utilised to automatically identify any change of defensive strategy. A classification model is developed based on a player and ball tracking dataset from National Basketball Association (NBA) game play to classify the adopted defensive strategy against pick-and-roll play. The methodology described is the first toanalyse the defensive strategy of all in-game players (both on-ball players and off-ball players). The cross-validation results indicate that the proposed technique for automatic defensive strategy identification can achieve up to 69% accuracy of classification. Machine learning techniques, such as the one adopted here, have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of player decision making and defensive game strategies in basketball and other sports, by leveraging the player and ball tracking data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
