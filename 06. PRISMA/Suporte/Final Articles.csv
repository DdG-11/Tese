In sports performance, artificial intelligence-driven analytics has become essential for optimizing athlete training, injury prevention, and performance enhancement, with sophisticated algorithms analyzing player data to develop personalized training programs and identify areas for improvement. The impact of artificial intelligence on fan engagement has been profound, enabling the delivery of highly personalized content and recommendations that foster stronger connections between fans and their favorite teams or athletes. Leveraging artificial intelligence-powered algorithms, ticket pricing strategies are optimized, resulting in increased ticket sales and revenue. Artificial intelligence-based performance evaluation tools assist sports managers in making well-informed decisions regarding team composition and tactics. This study shows the use of an artificial neural network with artificial intelligence technologies, including data analysis, to improve sports performance, management, and decision-making. Data-driven insights aid in talent scouting and recruitment, allowing managers to identify promising athletes with precision.

By integrating AI with advanced statistical models, sports professionals can gain deeper insights into player efficiency, tactics, and injury prevention. Traditional sports analysis methods rely on subjective assessments, basic statistical tools, and manual video analysis, which often result in inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and delayed decision-making. These limitations hinder optimal performance evaluation and proactive injury prevention. To address these challenges, we propose the Machine Learning for Performance Analysis and Injury Prediction (ML-PA-IP) framework, which integrates AI-driven machine learning models for real-time player performance tracking, biometric monitoring, and predictive injury analysis. This framework enhances accuracy, automates data processing, and enables proactive intervention. The proposed method applies ML-PA-IP to analyze vast datasets, including motion capture, physiological data, and historical performance metrics. It utilizes deep learning algorithms for player movement recognition, predictive analytics for injury risk assessment, and AI-based recommendations for optimizing training regimens. Findings indicate that ML-PA-IP significantly improves performance assessment accuracy, reduces injury occurrences by identifying risk factors in advance, and enhances game strategy through AI-driven insights.

In order to identify areas for improvement and potential injury risks, this proposed work aims to utilize the potential of AI techniques, such as XGBoost, to evaluate extensive player data, including movement patterns, biomechanics, and physical condition. This strategy is unusual because it combines real-time feedback systems with AI-powered predictive modeling to offer athletes and coaches individualized training advice and early warnings about potential injury risks. Cleaning and normalization were done during the preparation phase to make sure the data was suitable for analysis. Utilizing XGBoost for feature extraction allowed for the identification of critical factors affecting efficiency and injury risk.

Data were collected on AI techniques, biomechanical parameters, performance metrics, and implementation details. Results revealed a shift from traditional statistical models to advanced machine learning methods. Based on moderate-quality evidence from 12 studies, convolutional neural networks reached 94% agreement with international experts in technique assessment. Computer vision demonstrated accuracy within 15 mm compared to marker-based systems (6 studies, moderate quality). AI-driven training plans showed 25% accuracy improvements (4 studies, limited evidence). Random forest models predicted hamstring injuries with 85% accuracy (3 studies, moderate quality). Learning management systems enhanced knowledge transfer, raising coaches' understanding by 45% and athlete adherence by 3.4 times. Implementing integrated AI systems resulted in a 23% reduction in reinjury rates. However, significant challenges remain, including standardizing data, improving model interpretability, validating models in real-world settings, and integrating them into coaching routines. In summary, incorporating AI into sports biomechanics marks a groundbreaking advancement, providing analytical capabilities that surpass traditional techniques.

Among these industries, the sports sector is experiencing significant transformation, which needs support in accurately monitoring athlete predicting and performance injuries arising due to traditional methods’ limitations. Keeping the above in mind, in this article, we present the Intelligent Sports Management System (ISMS) with the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs), which enhance athlete monitoring and injury prediction. Our proposed ISMS consists of several layers: user interface, business logic layer, data management layer, integration layer, analytics and AI layer, IoT layer, and security layer. To facilitate interactions for athletes, coaches, and administrators, our planned ISMS integrates a user-friendly interface accessible through web and mobile applications. Besides, scheduling and event management are managed by the business logic layer. Similarly, the data management layer can process and store comprehensive data from various sources. To ensure smooth data exchange, the integration layer connects the ISMS with third-party services, and the analytics and AI layer leverages machine learning to provide actionable insights on performance and outcomes. In addition, the IoT layer collects real-time data from sensors and wearable devices, which is essential for performance analysis and injury prevention. Finally, the security layer ensures data integrity and confidentiality with robust encryption and access controls. To evaluate the system performance in different scenarios, we performed many experiments, which show that the proposed ISMS model shows the system efficacy in improving accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.97), recall (0.91), precision (0.93), F1 score (0.95), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.6), mean square error (MSE) (0.8), and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.9), compared to traditional methods.

Recently, AI has been introduced to the sports domain including the football (soccer) industry with applications in injury prediction and tactical analysis. However, the fact remains that the more complex an AI model is, the less explainable it becomes. Its black-box nature makes it difficult for human operators to understand its results, interpret its decisions and ultimately trust the model itself. This problem is magnified when the decisions and results suggested by an AI model affect the functioning of complex and multi-layered systems and entities, with a football club being such an example. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged for making an AI model more explainable, understandable and interpretable, thus assisting the creation of human-centered AI models.

The researcher designed a neural network model to predict the price of a football player for football clubs utilizing data from FIFA 19. The researcher thoroughly conducted an in-depth research on literature review to understand the inner workings of the neural networks as well as found related works on sports analytics and prediction. On the other hand, this research involved the hyper parameter optimization of the neural network with different activation functions, number neuron and layers, learning rate and its decay and L1 regularization. K-Fold cross validation is carried out to ensure the quality of the neural network. Simultaneous exploration is done to various aspects of neural network training is performed and their evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared and Root Mean Square are investigated. Lastly, the best performing model is chosen for the final model. The final model achieved a 95 percent accuracy and a 0.037 mean square error. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:23","2025-09-29 14:51:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Conference paper","<p>Cited by: 6</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This watershed will radically impact the ways we currently play, view, and even understand sport. Artificial intelligence(AI) is progressing rapidly, and it remains a matter of time until the impact on sport is fully realized. Currently in sport, AI is a tool used to assist humans with performance monitoring, supporter and media engagement, and injury prediction, among other functions. This commentary argues that advanced technologies can provide unfair playing advantages resulting in unintended and negative consequences. We assert that now is the time to discuss exactly who is in control of regulating the use of these, potentially game-changing innovations in sport. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","104 - 109","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we put forward the main hypothesis that the use of such models would be able to inform better about injury risks by considering the evolution of both internal and external loads over two horizons (one week and one month). Predictive models were trained with data collected by both GPS and subjective questionnaires and injury data from 40 elite male soccer players over one season. Various classification machine-learning algorithms that performed best on external and internal loads features were compared using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. In particular, tree-based algorithms based on non-linear models with an important interpretation aspect were privileged as they can help to understand internal and external load features impact on injury risk. For 1-week injury prediction, internal load features data were more accurate than external load features while for 1-month injury prediction, the best performances of classifiers were reached by combining internal and external load features. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-09-29 14:51:24","2025-09-29 14:51:24","","","","15","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","<p>Cited by: 49; All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
