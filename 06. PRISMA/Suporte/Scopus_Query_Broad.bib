	abstract = {Police forensic investigations are not immune to our society’s ubiquitous search for better predictive ability. In the particular and very topical case of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), police forensic investigations aim at evaluating whether a given impact or assault scenario led to the clinically observed TBI. This question is traditionally answered by means of forensic biomechanics and neurosurgical expertise which cannot provide a fully objective probabilistic measure. To this end, we propose here a numerical framework-based solution coupling biomechanical simulations of a variety of injurious impacts to machine learning training of police reports provided by the UK’s Thames Valley Police and the National Crime Agency’s National Injury Database. In this approach, the biomechanical predictions of mechanical metrics such as strain and stress distributions are interpreted by the machine learning model by additionally considering assault specific metadata to predict brain injury outcomes. The framework, only taking as input information typically available in police reports, reaches prediction accuracies exceeding 94% for skull fracture, 79% for loss of consciousness and intracranial haemorrhage, and is able to identify the best predictive features for each targeted injury. Overall, the proposed framework offers new avenues for the prediction, directly from police reports, of any TBI related symptom as required by forensic law enforcement investigations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent complication among critically ill patients, constituting around 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality rates ranging from 35 to 46%. Hence, early recognition and prediction of ARDS are crucial for the timely administration of targeted treatment. However, ARDS is frequently underdiagnosed or delayed, and its heterogeneity diminishes the clinical utility of ARDS biomarkers. This study aimed to observe the incidence of ARDS among high-risk patients and develop and validate an ARDS prediction model using machine learning (ML) techniques based on clinical parameters. Methods: This prospective cohort study in China was conducted on critically ill patients to derivate and validate the prediction model. The derivation cohort, consisting of 400 patients admitted to the ICU of the Peking University Third Hospital(PUTH) between December 2020 and August 2023, was separated for training and internal validation, and an external data set of 160 patients at the FU YANG People's Hospital from August 2022 to August 2023 was employed for external validation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen predictor variables. Multiple ML classification models were integrated to analyze and identify the best models. Several evaluation indexes were used to compare the model performance, including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive ex Planations (SHAP) is used to interpret ML models. Results: 400 critically ill patients were included in the analysis, with 117 developing ARDS during follow-up. The final model included gender, Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS), Hepatic Disease, Shock, and combined Lung Contusion. Based on the AUC and DCA in the validation group, the logistic model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an AUC of 0.836 (95% CI: 0.762–0.910). For external validation, comprising 160 patients, 44 of whom developed ARDS, the AUC was 0.799 (95% CI: 0.723–0.875), significantly outperforming the LIPS score alone. Conclusion: Combining the LIPS score with other clinical parameters in a logistic regression model provides a more accurate, clinically applicable, and user-friendly ARDS prediction tool than the LIPS score alone. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basketball remains among the most globally popular sports, with its various competitions drawing substantial attention. The analysis and modeling of basketball game data have long been central topics in sports analytics. In recent years, integrating machine learning techniques has facilitated significant advancements in predicting basketball game outcomes. However, most existing studies predominantly focus on NBA data, with relatively limited exploration of other leagues. To address this research gap, this study utilizes game data from the Chinese Basketball Association spanning the 2021–2024 seasons to develop predictive models. This research is the first to apply the classical Four Factors model and DefenseOfense model, along with their derivative versions (Four Factors detailed model and DefenseOfense detailed model), to the Chinese Men’s Professional Basketball League, providing a baseline for prediction. To ensure practical applicability of the models and enable their effective use in real-world scenarios, this study exclusively uses data available before the start of each game as feature variables for training. This approach ensures that the enhanced models can perform well in theoretical evaluations and provide reliable predictions when applied in practice. To evaluate model performance, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron with contrastive loss, and XGBoost are employed, with metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and AUROC used for comparison. The results reveal that the incorporation of additional features substantially enhances predictive performance. In particular, under the Logistic Regression framework, the newly developed model based on the Four Factors detailed achieves an accuracy of 85.49%, representing the highest predictive performance among all the evaluated approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Purpose of this study is to propose a new integrative framework for athletic performance prediction based on state-of-the-art machine learning analysis and biometric data biometric scanning. By merging physiological signals i.e., Heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, muscle activation patterns, with psychological signals i.e., mental toughness, athlete engagement, group cohesion along with contextual training data, we create a hybrid model that performs superiorly as compared to traditional unidimensional models. Our exercisers were trained using a gradient boosting and neural network to learn the very complex non-linear relationships that exist between the physical and the psychological performance drivers. With a rich sample set of 480 athletes from different sports, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) in predicting performance outcomes and outdid the conventional methods with statistical approaches R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) and machine learning based methods (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) And machine whiz methods. The robust results achieved from the model (over 90%) as compared to conventional nor statistical methods. From the analysis of the features’ importance, the strongest predictor of performance are the Provided Dedicated Athletes’ scores of the Functional Movement Screening (13.7%), athlete dedication (11.5%), maximum acceleration capabilities (10.2%), which verify the relationship along biomechanical, preconceived explosive power and psychological commitment. This reflects the finding whereby deep categorized athletic talent prediction requires a multi-dimensional approach by sophisticated fusion techniques. The framework is useful to coaches and sports scientists because it allows for the individualized design of injury risk mitigation and physiologically and psychologically-focused interpersonal help. This approach integrates multiple factors and constitutes an important progress in sports analytics by providing a comprehensive perspective on the complex realities which influence elite athletic performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Injury management is critical in all sports, directly impacting player performance. Baseball players are particularly susceptible to injuries, as players often compete in 5 to 7 games per week, placing continuous strain on their bodies. Among various injuries, Tommy John Surgery (TJS) poses a notable risk for Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. Traditional TJS prediction methods required sensors or video-based motion capture, which are impractical during actual games and limited in making predictions too close to the injuries, such as within 30 pitches. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that utilizes both classification and regression tasks. Using MLB pitching data (2016–2023), the classification model detects injury risk up to 100 days in advance with a high prediction performance of 0.73 F1-score, while the regression model estimates the time remaining until the player’s last pre-surgery game with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.79. In addition, to enhance our model’s applicability, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence technique to analyze the impacting mechanical features, such as a lowered four-seam fastball release point, that accelerate UCL deterioration, increasing TJS risk. These findings provide a practical foundation for early intervention strategies, potentially preserving pitcher health and reducing the need for complex surgical procedures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related liver injury poses a considerable clinical challenge for cancer patients. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable predictive model employing machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately identify patients at high risk of acute liver injury within one month of initiating ICI treatment. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included pan-cancer patients who received their first ICI treatment between March 2019 and September 2022 at Zhongshan Hospital. Six ML algorithms, namely neural networks (NN), gradient boosting classifier (GBC), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), categorical boosting classifier (CatBoost) and random forest (RF), were utilized to construct predictive models for acute ICI-related liver injury. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and brier score (BS). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to rank the feature importance and interpret the final model, providing insights into the contribution of each feature to liver injury prediction, thereby enhancing clinical interpretability. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300067470). Results: A total of 863 patients were enrolled in the study, with 22.71% experiencing liver injury within one month of ICI initiation. Among the six preliminary models, the RF model exhibited the best performance and was selected for the development of the final model. The SHAP method was utilized to rank variables from the six pre-models, with 10 variables selected for the final model by identifying the intersection of the top 20 most important variables across these models. The final RF model exhibited robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73–0.90) on the test set, and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.88) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72–0.89) in the 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. The Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) curve illustrated solid clinical benefit, and the calibration curve reflected good predictive consistency. Conclusion: An interpretable RF model was developed to predict acute liver injury occurring within one month after ICI treatment. This clinical-friendly model enables early identification of high-risk patients, facilitating optimized clinical management and ultimately improving treatment outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The current use of vision sensors for HSAR is a difficult task due to the intricate movements involved in sports and fitness workouts, as well as fluctuations in illumination conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) and their usage for human sports activities classification based on sensor data called ML-HSAR is presented in this article. A dataset containing 19 different human activities gathered from 8 different people through different types of sensors was used for this work; the dataset contains activities like sitting and standing, as well as other activities that require serious movements, such as running, cycling, and playing basketball. This study primarily aims to determine the performance of the considered ML models in accurately classifying these activities found in the dataset. The training of the algorithms and the subsequent evaluation were done on the segmented sensor data, effectively leveraging the dataset’s temporal aspect. In addition to the presented results for each of these algorithms, the limitations of each algorithm and their strengths in handling the complexities involved in HSAR were also presented. The contribution of this analysis is towards the understanding of the most appropriate ML models for HSAR tasks; it also offers valuable insights for future research and practical applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basketball Action Recognition (BAR) has received increasing attention in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence, serving as a fundamental component in performance evaluation, automated game annotation, tactical analysis, and referee decision-making support. Despite notable advancements driven by deep learning approaches, BAR remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of basketball movements, frequent occlusions, and limited availability of standardized benchmark datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured synthesis of current developments in BAR research, encompassing four principal dimensions: dataset curation, computational methodologies, synthetic data generation, and model explainability. A critical analysis of publicly available basketball-specific datasets is presented, delineating their modalities, annotation strategies, action taxonomies, and representational scope. Furthermore, the survey offers a structured classification of state-of-the-art action recognition methodologies, ranging from video-based and skeleton-based models to sensor-driven and multimodal fusion approaches, emphasizing architectural characteristics, evaluation protocols, and task-specific adaptations. The role of synthetic data is systematically examined as a means to address data scarcity, reduce annotation noise, and enhance model generalization through controlled variability and simulation-based augmentation. In parallel, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques is also analyzed, with a focus on post-hoc attribution methods, probabilistic reasoning models, and interpretable neural architectures, aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of decision-making processes. The survey identifies persisting research challenges, including dataset heterogeneity, limitations in cross-domain transferability, and the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in deep models. By delineating current limitations and prospective directions, this work provides a foundational reference to guide the development of robust, generalizable, and explainable BAR systems for deployment in real-world sports intelligence applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The complex interaction between various risk factors plays a crucial role in sports injuries. Preventive approaches should consider all of these factors to help identify at-risk individuals. Advanced machine-learning tools and artificial intelligence can be utilized for this purpose. This study aimed to develop an effective injury prediction model for lower-limb sports injuries. Methods: A total of 120 male university-level football, cricket, and basketball players underwent elaborate mental and physical screening, accounting for 44 variables. The injury details of the previous season were recorded. Using these data, different injury-predicting muscle-learning models were built, and their efficiencies were compared. Results: Thirty-eight injuries were recorded, 20 (52.6 %) of which corresponded to ankle injuries, nine to hamstring injuries (23.6 %), four to knee injuries (10.5 %), and five to foot injuries (13.3 %). Eight injuries occurred during the training phase, and 30 injuries occurred during the competition. Six players sustained the injuries twice. In this case, only the initial injury was considered. Finally, thirty-two injuries were used to construct the model. The model generated by the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm (KNN) with Random Oversampling (ROS) as an oversampling technique was found to be the best (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score = 0.87, true positive rate = 100 %, true negative rate = 62.5 %). Conclusions: The machine learning KNN model with ROS showed good accuracy in predicting athletes prone to injuries in football, cricket and basketball. This model would be helpful in injury prevention programs. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate the model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

TSPSO improves global search capability by incorporating advanced strategies into PSO, outperforming several PSO variants and rivaling top-tier algorithms such as LSHADE_cnEpSi on the IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark. Based on hematological data from a controlled murine ALI model, the developed bTSPSO-KELM achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of 91.43 %, sensitivity of 96.82 %, specificity of 82.49 %, precision of 90.40 %, Matthews correlation coefficient of 81.80 %, and an F-measure of 93.43 %. Notably, the method identifies hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean platelet volume, and lymphocyte percentage as key predictive features. In summary, this approach offers a robust and effective tool for enhancing ALI prediction accuracy and evaluating ALI in mice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) spanning from its inception in 2008 to the most recent 2024 season to identify and analyze key factors influencing cricket scores. Using the H2O AutoML framework, we develop a predictive model focused on identifying low first-innings scores, incorporating data on location, weather conditions, teams, and players, while distinguishing them from matches with par or high score. Explainable AI (XAI) tools are employed to quantify the influence of various match features on score predictions, ensuring transparency in the model's decision-making process. To further enhance classification performance, we introduce pre-match pitch report descriptions generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). For a subset of matches, we leverage multimodal LLM capabilities to analyse pitch report videos, comparing their predictive value against textual descriptions. Our findings underscore the potential of AI and machine learning in sports analytics, specifically in predicting cricket scores based on pitch conditions and other influential factors. This research provides valuable insights for teams, coaches, fantasy sports enthusiasts, IPL administrators and analysts, helping to optimize strategies based on available pre-match information.

As the dataset, we retrospectively reviewed the EHR of 95,027 adult patients (aged ≥ 20 years) and without including the PI was determined before admission who admission nursing assessment from Aug 2018 to Jun 2020. After evaluating different subsets of features, we determined that selecting 21 features(for example: Braden Scale, BMI, ICD, Barthel Index Total Number…) provided the best balance between predictive power and computational efficiency. The AI model's accuracy was maintained between 83-85% and the Changes in pressure injuries incidence rates were tracked over three years. RESULTS: Data Collection the Pressure injuries were recorded daily through nursing information systems. The Business Intelligence (BI) tools were used to analyze trends in pressure injuries incidence. The incidence rate of pressure injuries improved from 0.33% in 2022 to 0.21% in 2024. CONCLUSION: The proposed feature aggregation was critical in predicting risk of PI because feature aggregation could reduce false prediction in positive cases and make the higher predicting ability. Hence, our method may assist clinical physicians and nurses provide valuable information and understanding the method decision-making process. The AI for identifying high-risk cases and providing care recommendations, along with BI automated analysis, appears to have positively impacted the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure injuries.

A two-step evaluation and validation process secured validity, while applying linear optimization methodology, considering constraints such as salary and player position to recommend an eight-player line-up for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS). Four scenarios with 14 machine learning models and meta-models with a blending approach with an ensembling methodology were evaluated. Using individual per-player modeling, standard and advanced features, and different timespans resulted in accurate, well-established, and well-generalized predictions. Standard features improved MAPE results by 1.7–1.9% in the evaluation and 0.2–2.1% in the validation set. Additionally, two model selection cases were developed, with average scoring MAPEs of 28.90% and 29.50% and MAEs of 7.33 and 7.74 for validation sets. The most effective models included Voting Meta-Model, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge, AdaBoost, and Elastic Net. The research demonstrated practical application using predictions in a real-life DFS case evaluated in a DFS tournament on a specific match day. Among 11,764 real users, our Daily Line-up Optimizer ranked in the top 18.4%, and profitable line-ups reached the top 23.5%.

	abstract = {Field hockey involves repetitive high-intensity movements and physical contact, posing a high risk of injury. However, studies developing injury prediction models without relying on expensive tools such as GPS remain limited. This study aimed to develop an explainable AI model that predicts injury occurrence using only simple questionnaire-based data and visually identifies key predictors. Survey data were collected from 239 adult players registered with the Korea Field Hockey Association in 2024, including university and professional team athletes. Ten variables were used: sex, team affiliation, playing experience, player level, warm-up duration, weekly training hours and days, and physical indicators (age, height, weight). Injury was defined as an event within the past year that resulted in being unable to train for more than 24 h. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were compared. The final model—Logistic Regression—underwent SHAP-based visualization for interpretability. The Logistic Regression model showed the best performance in recall (0.6810 ± 0.0983), F1-score (0.6260 ± 0.0499), and AUC (0.6515 ± 0.0393). SHAP analysis identified Group, Training Time, Weight, and Player Level as key predictors, and visualized their contributions to individual predictions. This study demonstrates that a lightweight, interpretable injury prediction model using only simple survey data can achieve practical performance. This approach offers valuable insights for real-world applications and the development of injury prevention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: To evaluate the prognosis of patients with traumatic brain injury according to the computed tomography (CT) findings of skull fracture and cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from adult patients who received non-surgical or surgical treatment after the first CT scan with craniocerebral injuries from January 2020 to August 2021. The radiomics features were extracted by PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction was then performed using the max relevance and min-redundancy algorithm (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), with 10-fold cross-validation to select the best radiomics features. Three parsimonious machine learning classifiers, multinomial logistic regression, a support vector machine (SVM), and a naive Bayes (Gaussian distribution) classifier, were used to construct radiomics models. A personalized emergency prognostic nomogram for cranial injuries was created using a logistic regression model based on selected radiomic labels and patients' baseline information at emergency admission. Results: The mRMR algorithm and the LASSO regression model extracted 22 top-ranked radiologic features and based on these image histologic features, the emergency brain injury prediction model was built with SVM, logistic regression, and naive Bayes classifiers, respectively. The SVM model showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in training cohort for the 3 classifications, indicating that the SVM model is more stable and accurate. Moreover, a nomogram prediction model for Glasgow Outcome Scale prognostic score in patients was constructed. Conclusion: We established a nomogram for predicting patients' prognosis through radiomic features and clinical characteristics, which provides some data support and guidance for clinical prediction of patients' brain injury prognosis and intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, challenges such as the lack of domain-specific datasets and the complexity of athletes’ movements continue to hinder progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced pose estimation framework tailored to badminton players, built upon an improved YOLOv8-Pose architecture. In particular, we introduce an efficient local attention (ELA) mechanism that effectively captures fine-grained spatial dependencies and contextual information, thereby significantly improving the keypoint localization accuracy and overall pose estimation performance. To support this study, we construct a dedicated badminton pose dataset comprising 4000 manually annotated samples, captured using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The raw data undergo careful processing and refinement through a combination of depth-assisted annotation and visual inspection to ensure high-quality ground truth keypoints. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple attention modules and their integration strategies within the network, offering generalizable insights to enhance pose estimation models in other sports domains. The experimental results show that the proposed ELA-enhanced YOLOv8-Pose model consistently achieves superior accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), object keypoint similarity (OKS), and percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), highlighting its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sports vision tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data science has become an essential component in professional sports, particularly for predicting team performance and outcomes. This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models that accurately predict game outcomes in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). Method: A total of 859 games from the 2021 to 2023 regular seasons were analyzed, using both traditional baseball statistics and advanced sabermetric indicators such as the Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA), and Percentage of Leadoff Batters on Base (PLOB%). Five machine learning models—decision tree, logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were constructed and assessed through a five-fold cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, F1 scores, sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC-ROC. Results: Among the models, logistic regression and XGBoost achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 and an AUC-ROC from 0.97 to 0.98. The feature importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that the wRC+ and PLOB% were the most influential predictors, reflecting the offensive efficiency and pitching control.

To develop a predictive model that analyzes technical and tactical decisions in badminton, enhancing strategy development and performance evaluation for competitive gameplay, the proposed method, Puffer Fish Algorithm-tuned Intelligent Support Vector Machine (PFA-INT-SVM), combines the benefits of Pufferfish mutation with INT-SVM to improve prediction accuracy and classification tasks. The model utilizes data that encompasses player performance metrics, shot types, match context, opponent behavior, physical conditions, environmental factors, and tactical decisions. One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features, while normalization standardizes numerical data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that PFA-INT-SVM significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This model effectively predicts player performance and match outcomes, showing promising potential for enhancing badminton strategy development and analysis. The findings highlight the future of integrating machine learning techniques for advanced sports analytics and practical training applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Machine learning, although widely applied across various fields for many years, has only recently gained traction in sports science. It shows great promise in areas such as injury prediction and athlete performance forecasting. This study explores the potential of using machine learning to predict archers' performance based solely on specific physiological parameters. Initially, the total success score of each archer was recorded after three sets of six shots, alongside measurements of their quiet eye parameters. The quiet eye represents the final fixation of the eye on a target, critical for task accuracy. Based on their scores, archers were categorized as low-potential athletes or high-potential athletes using an machine learning clustering method. Subsequently, machine learning classification algorithms were applied to predict the performance class of archers using only quiet eye parameters. The study involved 18 archers (equally split by sex) who had consistently trained in archery for at least two years. The results indicated that the performance classification of archers could be predicted with approximately 90% reliability using only quiet eye data. The findings suggest that machine learning based on quiet eye parameters offers a time-efficient alternative to traditional methods for identifying high-potential archers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence, machine vision, and the Internet of Things have significantly impacted sports analytics, particularly basketball, where accurate measurement and analysis of player performance have become increasingly important. This study proposes a real-time goal state recognition system based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, focusing on four shooting scenarios: rebounds, swishes, other shots, and misses. By installing IMU sensors around the basketball net, the system captures real-time data on acceleration, angular velocity, and angular changes to comprehensively analyze the fluency and success rate of shooting execution, utilizing five deep learning models—convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM-Attention—to classify shot types. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM-Attention model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 87.79% in identifying goal states. This result represents a commanding level of real-time goal state recognition, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the model in complex sports environments. This high accuracy not only supports the application of the system in skill analysis and sports performance evaluation but also lays a solid foundation for the development of intelligent basketball training equipment, providing an efficient and practical solution for athletes and coaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Vehicle accidents, particularly PV-PV collisions, result in significant property damage and driver injuries, causing substantial economic losses and health risks. Most existing studies focus on macro-level predictions, such as accident frequency, but lack detailed collision-level analysis, which limits the precision of severity prediction. This study investigates various accident-related factors, including environmental conditions, vehicle attributes, driver characteristics, pre-crash scenarios, and collision dynamics. Data from NHTSA’s CRSS and FARS datasets were integrated and balanced using random over-sampling and under-sampling techniques to address severity-level data imbalances. The mRMR algorithm was employed for feature selection to minimize redundancy and identify key features. Five advanced machine learning models were evaluated for severity prediction, with XGBoost achieving the best performance: 84.9% accuracy, 84.85% precision, 84.90% recall, and an F1-score of 84.87%. SHAP analysis was utilized to interpret the model and conduct a comprehensive analysis of accident features, including their importance, dependencies, and combined effects on severity prediction. This study achieved high accuracy in predicting accident severity across all levels in PV-PV collisions. Moreover, by integrating the SHAP model interpretation method, we conducted detailed feature analysis at global, local, and individual case levels, thereby filling the gap in PV-PV accident severity prediction and feature analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective This study aimed to develop an innovative early prediction model for acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, leveraging preoperative and postoperative clinical variables, and to identify key risk factors associated with AKI. Methods Retrospective data from 1,304 cardiac surgery patients (1,028 AKI cases and 276 non-AKI controls) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. We analyzed three datasets: preoperative 48-hour averages, preoperative 48-hour maxima, and postoperative 24-hour maxima of critical physiological parameters. Using logistic regression, LASSO regression, and random forest (RF) algorithms, we constructed nine prediction models, evaluating their performance via AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, Youden’s index, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. Results Our findings demonstrate that all models achieved AUROC values >0.7, with three models exceeding 0.75. Notably, the logistic regression model incorporating preoperative 48-hour maximum values and postoperative 24-hour maximum values exhibited the highest predictive accuracy (AUROC = 0.755, 95%CI: 0.7185–0.7912), outperforming other configurations. This model’s superiority lies in its integration of dynamic preoperative and postoperative variables, capturing both baseline risks and acute postoperative changes. By systematically comparing multiple machine learning approaches, our study highlights the utility of combining temporal physiological metrics to enhance AKI risk stratification. These results offer a robust, clinically applicable tool for early AKI prediction, enabling proactive interventions to improve outcomes in cardiac surgery patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: To externally validate the persistent electronic alert (PersEA) machine learning model for predicting persistent severe acute kidney injury (psAKI), addressing the scarcity of validated prediction models. Patients and Methods: We included adult patients (18 years or older) admitted to intensive care unit with at least stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI) at a tertiary medical center, using retrospective data collected between January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2022. The data were accessed and analyzed during the period from March 1st, 2023, through July 28th, 2023. The psAKI was defined as AKI stage 3 lasting for ≥72 hours or AKI leading to death in 48 hours or kidney replacement therapy in 1 day. The performance of the PersEA model, a boosted tree algorithm fed by hourly patient data via electronic health records to provide real-time psAKI predictions, was evaluated using specific metrics that penalize late alarms. We measured the area under the receiver operating characteristic and the area under the precision-recall curves. Results: After screening, 4479 patients from the Mayo Clinic cohort were included in the current external validation study, with 234 (5.22%) having psAKI. Results from the Amsterdam UMCdb (531 patients, 59 [11.11%] positive) and MIMIC-III (495 patients, 57 [11.52%] positive) cohorts were obtained in a prior development study. The model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.98) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.60-0.73), and when applying the threshold that reached 0.80 sensitivity on the internal cohort, PersEA achieved 0.88 sensitivity, 0.94 specificity, and 0.47 precision, all based on Mayo Clinic data. Conclusion: The PersEA model performed excellently on an external cohort, showing that it is scalable on high-quality data with little to no tuning once a noisy training set is chosen. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The significance of data analysis in high-performance sports has largely increased in recent years, offering opportunities for further exploration using machine learning techniques. SailGP is a relatively new sailing event driven by a passion for speed and innovation. The racing series brings excitement and thrill to the world of sailing that has been relatively unexplored. As a pioneer work in the academic community, our work showcases the power of data-driven approaches in enhancing performance and decision-making at high-performance sailing events. We explore data mining techniques on datasets collected at high-performance sailing events in Bermuda in 2021 and Italy in 2023. By analysing race data, the study aims to gain insights into the relationship between variables such as wind speed, wind direction, foil usage, and daggerboard adjustments, and their impact on boat speed. For a comprehensive understanding, we used three distinct methodologies. Various prediction models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and a stacked model, were employed and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score and mean squared error. The results demonstrate the models’ ability to accurately predict boat speed. Anomaly detection techniques examined boat stability, adding a new chapter to the research. Additionally, we introduced a reinforcement learning approach to identify optimal settings for speed enhancement, representing another new dimension of the study. These findings refine race strategies, optimise sail and rudder settings, and improve performance in SailGP races. Future plans include collaborating with SailGP to work with larger datasets and integrate models into live racing scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Eight machine learning models-Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-were used for cross-valuation using eight different feature datasets; the occurrence of AKI serves as the outcome variable. The LightGBM model in conjunction with the XGBset dataset shows the best performance according to the outcomes. Incorporating 19 clinical characteristics, the LightGBM model was finally chosen to provide an early risk prediction model for AKI occurrences. With an AUC of 0.97 and an accuracy of 0.88 the model performed. Moreover, SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were proposed to improve the interpretability of the machine learning model, so increasing the transparency and clinical relevance of the prediction outcomes. Finally, this work shows that a predictive model with just 19 characteristics can still show good predictive accuracy, therefore offering vital support for individualized intervention and early AKI prediction. The application of interpretability methods provides insightful analysis for clinical decision-making, therefore guiding medical practitioners in their informed decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the past 60 years, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has played a key role in the withdrawal of marketed drugs due to safety concerns. Early prediction of DILI is crucial for developing safer pharmaceuticals, yet current in vitro and in vivo testing methods are complex and cumbersome. In this study, we developed an extreme gradient boosting (XGB)-powered machine learning (ML) model for DILI prediction. Comparing various DILI prediction models is challenging because they rely on different public data sets. We comprehensively evaluated the proposed BoostDILI model to address two crucial questions: 1. Can insights derived from public data sets help in DILI prediction for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs? 2. Can we generate structural alerts to improve the model’s explainability? To address the first question, we developed a DILI prediction model using four publicly available data sets. This effort led to the creation of the BoostDILI model, which achieved a 5-fold CV accuracy of 0.70. A sequential feature selection method was employed to identify relevant descriptors. This model integrates feature-level representations derived from RDKit (12 features) and Mordred (23 features) features. Bayesian statistics was applied to identify high-performance substructures iteratively, and a structural alerts model was developed to address the second question. The developed model was further validated with two FDA-approved drug data sets, DILIst and DILIRank. The BoostDILI model offers a trustable solution for evaluating the DILI risk in preclinical research. The structural alerts help in identifying the substructures that may be responsible for DILI.

	abstract = {With the advancement of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have made a significant contribution on sports communication, especially in the field of enhancing audience engagement, personalized content recommendations, real-time data analysis, and targeted advertising. Predicting sports outcomes is still a challenging assignment because of some unpredictable factors such as player performance, weather, and tactical decisions. Traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms, like logistic regression and XGBoost, have had limited success in capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional data. In this study we explore the novel application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the outcome of sports event. Leveraging CNNs’ ability to identify intricate patterns, the proposed method shows improved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score compared to other six traditional models, achieving up to 93%- 97%, 87.8%-92.2%, 91.5%-96.5% and 90.7-92.9 respectively. Besides, while there are some fluctuations influenced by Gaussian noise, the four targets of our model are still much higher than other traditional models, and both of results could show the stability and reliability of the model. The result of these could not only indicate that CNN offers a promising method for enhancing sports analytics, but also permits reliable and accurate predictions of complicated datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics is a fast-evolving domain using advanced data science methods to find useful insights. This study explores the way NBA player performance metrics evolve from quarter to quarter and affect game outcomes. Using Association Rule Mining, we identify key offensive, defensive, and overall impact metrics that influence success in both regular-season and playoff contexts. Defensive metrics become more critical in late-game situations, while offensive efficiency is paramount in the playoffs. Ball handling peaks in the second quarter, affecting early momentum, while overall impact metrics, such as Net Rating and Player Impact Estimate, consistently correlate with winning. In the collected dataset we performed preprocessing, applying advanced anomaly detection and discretization techniques. By segmenting performance into five categories—Offense, Defense, Ball Handling, Overall Impact, and Tempo—we uncovered strategic insights for teams, coaches, and analysts. Results emphasize the importance of managing player fatigue, optimizing lineups, and adjusting strategies based on quarter-specific trends. The analysis provides actionable recommendations for coaching decisions, roster management, and player evaluation. Future work can extend this approach to other leagues and incorporate additional contextual factors to refine evaluation and predictive models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction Force plate systems are increasingly utilized in the armed forces that claim to identify individuals at risk of musculoskeletal injury. However, factors influencing injury risk scores from a force plate system (SpartaScience™) and the effects of experimental perturbations on these scores remain unclear. Methods Healthy males (n = 823; 22.7 ± 3.9 yr) performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) on SpartaScience™ force plates. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of the system's proprietary Musculoskeletal (MSK) Health score, which were then experimentally perturbed. Twelve males (30.9 ± 4.3 yr) participated in a test-retest reliability study, performing three standard CMJs and one experimentally manipulated jump (50% effort) due to the observed relationship between the MSK Health score, vertical jump height, and body weight. Results The MSK Health score was negatively correlated with vertical jump height and positively with body weight (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, P < 0.001). Each inch increase in jump height decreased the MSK Health score by an average of 1.27 units (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.36), whereas each pound of body weight increased it by 0.12 units (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.13). Notably, 83% of participants in the reliability study improved their MSK Health score on the 50% effort jump. Conclusions The study revealed atypical relationships between MSK Health scores, vertical jump height, and body weight, with vertical jump height playing a majority role in predicting the principal output (MSK Health score). Findings indicated a higher injury risk with greater jump height but a lower risk with increased body weight. In addition, MSK Health scores paradoxically improved with lower effort (i.e., lower vertical jump height), which highlights the dangers of using undisclosed and unvetted algorithms for the prediction of health outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing utilization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) makes it critical to understand and mitigate their involvement in traffic accidents. This study, therefore, addresses a significant gap in the research on AV safety by focusing on predicting the possibility of injuries in AV-involved crashes. The California Department of Motor Vehicles’ comprehensive dataset of accidents that occurred from 2014 to May 2024 was utilized, and advanced machine learning techniques were applied to develop a model capable of predicting the outcomes of accidents involving AVs. The study found that the bagging classifier model outperforms other models in reliably predicting and identifying severe crashes and minimizing misclassification. Evaluations made through precision-recall, validation, and learning curves confirm the model's robustness, ability to generalize across data subsets, and effectiveness in increasing training data. Key predictors of crash severity include the extent of damage to the AV, vehicle type, manufacturer, and presence of a traffic signal. The study highlights the importance of tailored safety measures, robust safety mechanisms, and advanced traffic management systems to mitigate crash severity. The real-world application of this advanced model promises substantial benefits for vehicle manufacturers, urban planners, policymakers, and end-users, and will contribute to safer roadways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Incorporating statistics into sports analytics is increasingly common, especially in predicting volleyball match outcomes. The discrete nature of volleyball scores, particularly the number of sets won, aligns well with binomial parameter estimators. While existing literature explores methods such as logistic regression, Bayesian approaches, and machine learning techniques, binomial estimation offers a simpler and more versatile approach that suits various scenarios in practice. This article introduces and compares six estimation methods for volleyball match prediction, all based on modified estimators of the binomial parameter. Simulations were conducted to forecast the outcome of the FIVB Volleyball Women’s Nations League 2023. Our findings indicate that the model using traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) outperforms others, as evidenced by metrics such as Mean Square Error and Kendall’s Tau. While the TMLE demonstrates the highest predictive accuracy, it is important to recognize the advantages of models that adjust the estimation of the probability for tail values. Specifically, these models show a significant improvement in predictive capabilities for underdog teams, thereby enhancing the overall reliability in forecasting match outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study integrates data analysis and machine learning techniques to investigate workplace injury prediction and mitigation in surface mining operations. Injury data (from March 2023 to Aug 2024) was collected from mechanised limestone mines in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, encompassing 446 workers' demographic details, health data and workplace conditions. The methodology involved exploratory data analysis, linear and non-linear regression models and advanced machine learning algorithms such as XG Boost, random forest, decision tree, and Bayesian ridge regression. risk factors namely skill level (semi-skilled), age (mean 43 years), experiences (mean 14 years), designation, qualifications, health status, work environment, and safety culture were analysed to predict injury occurrences. The results reveal that near misses and minor incidents are significant early indicators (T-value 1.35) of severe injuries, emphasising proactive safety measures. Among the models evaluated, XG Boost well performed with a training R-squared of 0.95 and test R-squared of 0.43, demonstrating its superior ability to generalise and capture complex relationships in the data. The analysis found that injuries are moderately common for contractual workers (mean: 0.90 per instance), with significant variability in near misses (mean: 8.05). Standardised working conditions, such as uniform duty hours (8 hrs.) and leave entitlements (30 days/year), contribute to the occurrence of injuries (t-value 1.35). Proactive measures to be taken in addressing factors like worker skill levels, availability of safety features and positive attitudes toward safety, are crucial for mitigating injuries at workplaces. Major Findings: From the study it can be concluded that the factors namely fire (T-value=5.64), experience (T-value=4.69), skill level (T-value=5.08), positive attitude towards safety (T-value=3.68), medical facilities (T-value=4.35), working conditions of the site (T-value=5.23) and available equipment with safety features (T-value=4.55) are the significant factors that contribute to the occurrence of the injuries among contractual workers in surface mines. The machine learning algorithm models namely extreme gradient boost (XG Boost) performed best for the prediction of the injuries data consider for the study with training data set, (R-squared 0.95) and testing data set (R-squared 0.43). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Pressure injury prevention is important in older patients with immobility. This requires an accurate and efficient prediction of the development of pressure injuries. We aimed to develop a method for estimating skin temperature changes due to ischemia and inflammation using temperature sensors placed under bedsheets to provide an objective, non-invasive, and non-constrained risk assessment tool. Methods: This study consisted of a thermal skin simulation study and a descriptive correlation study in healthy participants. A thermal skin simulation study was conducted using a model reproducing the body surface (underwear, diaper, or wet diaper conditions) and bed environment. In a descriptive-correlational study, the participants lay supine on a mattress with a temperature sensor attached to their sacral skin. Findings: The thermal skin simulation study showed that temperature changes in the skin can be estimated under the sheets by inputting time-shifted temperature data into machine learning (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9967 for underwear, 0.9950 for diapers, and 0.9869 for wet diapers). It was also demonstrated that the absolute skin temperature of a healthy individual (N = 17) could be estimated with the best accuracy by inputting time-shifted data into an extra-tree regressor (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8145). Interpretation: A combination of interface pressure and temperature sensors can be used to estimate skin temperature changes. These findings contribute to the development of a skin temperature measurement method that can capture temperature changes over time in clinical settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A dataset comprising 458 T-20I matches from 2005 to 2024 was analyzed using seven machine learning models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Neural Networks, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Model performance was systematically evaluated through metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and Area under the Curve (AUC), with robustness confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations across variable match conditions. Results highlight Random Forest and Decision Tree models as the most accurate and reliable, consistent with theoretical expectations for ensemble and decision-based models in complex, multi-factor analyses.

This study presents StackDILI, a computational framework designed to accelerate toxicity assessment by predicting DILI risk. StackDILI integrates multiple molecular descriptors to extract structural and physicochemical features, including the constitution, pharmacophore, MACCS, and E-state descriptors. Additionally, a genetic algorithm is employed for feature selection and optimization, ensuring that the most relevant features are used. These optimized features are processed through a stacking ensemble model comprising multiple tree-based machine learning models, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability. Notably, StackDILI demonstrates a strong performance on the DILIrank test set and maintains robustness across cross-validation. Moreover, interpretability analysis reveals key molecular features associated with DILI risks, providing valuable insights into toxicity prediction. To further improve accessibility, a user-friendly web interface is developed, allowing users to input SMILES strings and receive rapid predictions with ease. The StackDILI model provides a powerful tool for efficient DILI assessment, supporting safer drug development.

	abstract = {This paper introduces an advanced framework for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) and Semantic Event Classification (SEC), addressing the growing demand for sophisticated human skeleton modeling, context-aware feature extraction, and machine learning techniques for accurate event recognition in real-world scenarios. HPE, a fundamental task in applications such as sports analytics and surveillance systems, involves predicting human joint locations from visual data. Despite substantial progress driven by deep learning advancements, particularly in handling occlusions and crowded environments, a comprehensive integration of these innovations remains limited in current literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel HPE and SEC system featuring a robust six-stage pipeline. The workflow begins with preprocessing steps, including video-to-image sequence conversion, floor removal to reduce noise, grayscale transformation, and human silhouette extraction via binary masks. Human detection is performed using the GrabCut algorithm. Full-body feature extraction incorporates 1-D Fourier Transform, 2-D energy-based motion analysis, 0–180° intensity mapping via the Radon Transform algorithm, and movable body part detection using Fourier-Based Correlation. Key point features are characterized through the degree of freedom, human landmark detection via the HSV algorithm, and angular point analysis using the media pipe algorithm. Features are then optimized using the Ray Optimizer and classified through a Neuro-Fuzzy classifier. The proposed system achieves classification accuracies of 94.82%, 92.33%, and 93.63% on the UCF Sports Actions, Human Action Recognition (HAR), and MPII Human Pose datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling real-world challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study highlights the importance of offensive metrics such as points scored and offensive ratings in predicting an NCAA player's chances of being drafted into the NBA by utilizing an unsupervised learning clustering model and a supervised decision tree model. This underscores the significance of offensive statistics in a player's skill set and suggests that players and coaches should prioritize improving these metrics to enhance a player's draft potential. The study found that defensive metrics like defensive ratings and blocks have less impact on overall draft potential than offensive metrics. A crucial point to note is that a team's success often relies on having its top players actively participating on the court. This research enhances our understanding of the factors influencing the draft prospects of NCAA basketball players.

	abstract = {In recent years, growth in technology has significantly impacted various industries, including sports, health, e-commerce, and agriculture. Among these industries, the sports sector is experiencing significant transformation, which needs support in accurately monitoring athlete predicting and performance injuries arising due to traditional methods’ limitations. Keeping the above in mind, in this article, we present the Intelligent Sports Management System (ISMS) with the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs), which enhance athlete monitoring and injury prediction. Our proposed ISMS consists of several layers: user interface, business logic layer, data management layer, integration layer, analytics and AI layer, IoT layer, and security layer. To facilitate interactions for athletes, coaches, and administrators, our planned ISMS integrates a user-friendly interface accessible through web and mobile applications. Besides, scheduling and event management are managed by the business logic layer. Similarly, the data management layer can process and store comprehensive data from various sources. To ensure smooth data exchange, the integration layer connects the ISMS with third-party services, and the analytics and AI layer leverages machine learning to provide actionable insights on performance and outcomes. In addition, the IoT layer collects real-time data from sensors and wearable devices, which is essential for performance analysis and injury prevention. Finally, the security layer ensures data integrity and confidentiality with robust encryption and access controls. To evaluate the system performance in different scenarios, we performed many experiments, which show that the proposed ISMS model shows the system efficacy in improving accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.97), recall (0.91), precision (0.93), F1 score (0.95), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.6), mean square error (MSE) (0.8), and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.9), compared to traditional methods. From these results, it is clear that our suggested approach improves athlete performance monitoring, injury prevention plans, and training schedules by presenting a complete and novel solution for recent sports management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The study aims to assess and compare the predictive effectiveness of football-related injuries using external load data and a decision tree classification algorithm by unidimensional approach. Methods: The sample consisted of 25 players from one of the 16 teams participating in the Persian Gulf Pro League during the 2022--2023 season. Player injury data and raw GPS data from all training and competition sessions throughout the football league season were gathered (214 training sessions and 34 competition sessions). The acute-tochronic workload ratio was calculated separately for each variable using a ratio of 1:3 weeks. Finally, the decision tree algorithm with machine learning was utilised to assess the predictive power of injury occurrence based on the acute-to-chronic workload ratio. Results: The results showed that the variable of the number of decelerations had the highest predictive power compared to other variables [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, recall = 87.5%, precision = 58.3%, accuracy = 94.7%]. Conclusion: Although none of the selected external load variables in this study had high predictive power (AUC > 0.95), due to the high predictive power of injury of the number of deceleration variables compared with other variables, the necessity of attention and management of this variable as a risk factor for injury occurrence is essential for preventing future injuries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in sports analytics has transformed decision-making pro- cesses, enhancing fairness and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel AI-driven image recognition system for automatically detecting offside and foul events in football matches. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention or traditional image processing techniques, our approach utilizes a hybrid deep learning model that combines advanced object tracking with motion analysis to deliver real-time, precise event detection. The system employs a robust, self-learning algorithm that leverages spatiotemporal features from match footage to track player movements and ball dynamics. By analyzing the continuous flow of video data, the model detects offside positions and identifies foul types such as tackles, handballs, and dangerous play—through a dynamic pattern recognition process. This multi- tiered approach overcomes traditional methods’ limitations by accurately identifying critical events with minimal latency, even in complex, high-speed scenarios. In experiments conducted on diverse datasets of live match footage, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.85% for offside detection and 98.56% for foul identification, with precision rates of 98.32% and 97.12%, respectively. The system's recall rates of 97.45% for offside detection and 96.85% for foul recognition demonstrate its reliability in real-world applications. It's clear from these results that the proposed framework can automate and greatly enhance the accuracy of match analysis, making it a useful tool for both referees and broadcasters. The system's low computational overhead and growing ability make connecting to existing match broadcasting infrastructure easy. This establishes an immediate feedback loop for use during live games. This work marks a significant step forward in applying AI and computer vision for sports, introducing a powerful method to enhance the objectivity and precision of officiating in football. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study addresses the lack of objective player-based metrics in men’s rugby league by introducing a comprehensive set of novel performance metrics designed to quantify a player’s overall contribution to team success. Methods: Player match performance data were captured by Stats Perform for every National Rugby League season from 2018 until 2022; a total of five seasons. The dataset was divided into offensive and defensive variables and further split according to player position. Five machine learning algorithms (Principal Component Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Regression Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boost) were considered in the analysis, which ultimately generated Wins Created and Losses Created for offensive and defensive performance, respectively. These two metrics were combined to create a final metric of Net Wins Added. The validity of these player performance metrics against traditional objective and subjective measures of performance in rugby league were evaluated. Results: The metrics correctly predicted the winner of 80.9% of matches, as well as predicting the number of team wins per season with an RMSE of 1.9. The metrics displayed moderate agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.505) when predicting team of the year award recipients. When predicting State of Origin selection, the metrics displayed moderate agreement for New South Wales (0.450) and substantial agreement for Queensland (0.652). Conclusion: The development and validation of these objective player performance metrics represent significant potential to enhance talent evaluation and player recruitment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics has the potential to provide a comprehensive analysis of player data and unlock deep insights that can be used to enhance performance and improve training. In this work, we collect hand and arm inertial data of basketball shots and perform deep analysis to determine key factors that contribute to three main questions: the shot outcomes, the position of shots, and the experience level of players. We also investigate how well machine learning-based models can answer these three questions. To do this, we engineered statistical-based features from the shot inertial data. Then, we trained and evaluated the performance of five machine learning models. The results show that the experience level of the player can be accurately determined from the inertial data by both an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector classifier (SVC). An extreme gradient boosted (XGBoost) model had the best success classifying the location from which the shot was taken with an accuracy of 94%. Finally, SVC predicted the outcome of the shot as either a miss or a basket, with an accuracy of 76%. Further analysis revealed that the arm and hand accelerations and rotation in the y-axis are critical factors in basketball shooting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using small inertial sensors worn by basketball players to track and collect crucial data during training sessions which can then be used to predict and improve performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Injury prediction in athletes is a critical aspect of sports medicine, where early identification is essential for minimizing the risk of severe injuries and enhancing athletic performance. This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to assess injury risk by analyzing key physiological metrics such as heart rate, impact force, activity duration, and skin temperature. A dataset containing athlete performance data under different conditions is examined to identify the predictive relevance of these features. Traditional classification methods faced challenges due to the non-collinear nature of the data, whereas boosting techniques proved to be the most effective, delivering the highest prediction accuracy. This research evaluates various ML models, including boosting algorithms, neural networks, and conventional classifiers, comparing their predictive capabilities. Using AutoML, AutoGluon determined that the Weighted Ensemble model outperformed other approaches, achieving an accuracy of 81.17%. To complement the injury prediction model, this study also incorporates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Training Recommendation Model, which dynamically adjusts training regimens based on real-time physiological and biomechanical feedback. By optimizing training intensity and workload distribution, the RL model helps minimize injury risk while ensuring an appropriate and effective training regimen. The recommendation system is designed to be flexible, allowing for continuous adaptation and improvement as more data becomes available. This integrated approach enhances informed decision-making for coaches, medical professionals, and athletes, facilitating proactive injury prevention while maintaining peak performance levels. By leveraging ML-driven injury prediction and RL-based training recommendations, this study presents a comprehensive, scalable, and adaptable framework for athlete management. The results emphasize the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing sports science, reducing rehabilitation costs, and optimizing performance through personalized, data-driven interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of FIFA World Cup match outcomes holds significant value for analysts, coaches, bettors, and fans. This paper presents a machine learning framework specifically designed to forecast match winners in FIFA World Cup. By integrating both team-level historical data and player-specific performance metrics such as goals, assists, passing accuracy, and tackles, we capture nuanced interactions often overlooked by traditional aggregate models. Our methodology processes multi-year data to create year-specific team profiles that account for evolving rosters and player development. We employ classification techniques complemented by dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter optimization, to yield robust predictive models. Experimental results on data from the FIFA 2022 World Cup demonstrate our approach's superior accuracy compared to baseline method. Our findings highlight the importance of incor-porating individual player attributes and team-level composition to enhance predictive performance, offering new insights into player synergy, strategic match-ups, and tournament progression scenarios. This work underscores the transformative potential of rich, player-centric data in sports analytics, setting a foundation for future exploration of advanced learning architectures such as graph neural networks to model complex team interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study presents an interpretable surrogate framework for predicting pedestrian-leg injury severity that integrates high-fidelity finite-element (FE) simulations with a TabNet-based deep-learning model. We generated a parametric dataset of 3000 impact scenarios—covering ten vehicle types and various legform impactors—using automated FE runs configured via Latin hypercube sampling. After preprocessing and one-hot encoding of categorical features, we trained TabNet alongside Support-Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Decision-Tree ensembles. All models underwent hyperparameter tuning via Optuna’s Bayesian optimization coupled with repeated four-fold cross-validation (20 trials per model). TabNet achieved the best balance of explanatory power and predictive accuracy, with an average R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94 ± 0.01 and RMSE = 0.14 ± 0.02. On an independent test set, 85%, 88%, and 90% of predictions for tibial acceleration, knee-flexion angle, and shear displacement, respectively, fell within ±20% of true peaks. SHAP-based analyses confirm that collision-point location and bumper geometry dominate injury outcomes. These results demonstrate TabNet’s capacity to deliver rapid, robust, and explainable injury predictions, offering actionable design insights for vehicle front-end optimization and regulatory assessment in early development stages. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered sports analytics is revolutionizing athlete performance assessment by leveraging data science to enhance decision-making and training strategies. By integrating AI with advanced statistical models, sports professionals can gain deeper insights into player efficiency, tactics, and injury prevention. Traditional sports analysis methods rely on subjective assessments, basic statistical tools, and manual video analysis, which often result in inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and delayed decision-making. These limitations hinder optimal performance evaluation and proactive injury prevention. To address these challenges, we propose the Machine Learning for Performance Analysis and Injury Prediction (ML-PA-IP) framework, which integrates AI-driven machine learning models for real-time player performance tracking, biometric monitoring, and predictive injury analysis. This framework enhances accuracy, automates data processing, and enables proactive intervention. The proposed method applies ML-PA-IP to analyze vast datasets, including motion capture, physiological data, and historical performance metrics. It utilizes deep learning algorithms for player movement recognition, predictive analytics for injury risk assessment, and AI-based recommendations for optimizing training regimens. Findings indicate that ML-PA-IP significantly improves performance assessment accuracy, reduces injury occurrences by identifying risk factors in advance, and enhances game strategy through AI-driven insights. By leveraging AI-powered sports analytics, coaches, trainers, and athletes can make data-driven decisions that optimize performance, prevent injuries, and achieve long-term success in competitive sports. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, sports data analysis has emerged as a rapidly growing research field, becoming one of the core aspects of modern sports management. It can assist coaches and sports managers in predicting match outcomes and evaluating team and player performance. One of the most popular sports competitions, the NBA basketball games, has been the subject of numerous studies where various machine learning (ML) models have been used to predict game outcomes. However, previous research has primarily focused on traditional machine learning models, often overlooking the complex relationships between players within a team and their performance in interaction with other teammates. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid model to predict NBA teams' qualification for the playoffs, utilizing complete game data from the 2007-2008 to 2017-2018 seasons. The experiments in this study were based on three different data scenarios: team statistical features on a per-game basis, purely network-based features, and finally, a combination of statistical and network features of the games. The results of this study indicate that the use of the hybrid approach significantly increased prediction accuracy across various models. Furthermore, in the hybrid approach, both the Logistic Regression and XGBoost models, with an accuracy of 93%, demonstrated the best performance compared to other models. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for future research in predicting and analyzing the performance of basketball teams. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As sports data, increasingly shaped by recent advances in in-game data acquisition technologies, become more complex and high-dimensional, analyzing such multimodal datasets presents challenges in both predictive performance and interpretability. Therefore, in this study, we introduce PassAI, a novel machine learning framework for classifying soccer passes success or failure using spatiotemporal tracking images and player-specific statistical profiles. PassAI addresses these challenges with an original dual-stream architecture that processes image-based and tabular features separately and then combines them for final prediction. Additionally, a two-stage explanation module was implemented to provide interpretable insights from both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. This module allows end users (e.g., coaches and analysts) understand whether pass outcomes depend more on contextual dynamics or individual player traits. In experiments involving 6,349 passes from professional Japanese soccer league games, PassAI outperformed state-of-the-art models - including convolutional neural network-based and graph neural network-based approaches, as well as existing pass prediction models - by more than 5% in accuracy. It also provided interpretable feedback through visual saliency maps and feature sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, RemOve And Retrain was also performed to verify the faithfulness of the generated explanation, and the visual saliency maps were highly faithful. Although there remains room for improvement from a practical standpoint, the results of this study indicate the potential of explainable multimodal artificial intelligence systems in real-world, high-stakes decision-making environments such as professional sports. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The integration of robotic-assisted techniques in urologic oncology recovery has significantly improved surgical precision and patient outcomes. However, postoperative rehabilitation remains a crucial challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for enhancing physical recovery and quality of life. Personalized sports recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging sports analytics, machine learning, and biomechanical modeling to tailor rehabilitation exercises. Traditional methods rely on generalized rehabilitation protocols, often failing to consider individual patient conditions, recovery progress, and biomechanical constraints. These limitations hinder optimal rehabilitation and prolong recovery times. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating robotic-assisted assessment with personalized sports analytics. Our approach utilizes a Dynamic Sports Performance Network (DSPN), which combines spatiotemporal data analysis, reinforcement learning, and real-time feedback mechanisms to optimize exercise recommendations. By incorporating multi-agent learning and predictive modeling, the system adapts rehabilitation plans based on patient performance, ensuring a tailored and effective recovery process. The system can integrate wearable sensor data and EMG signals to further refine exercise precision and monitor muscular responses in real time. Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional rehabilitation strategies, offering higher precision in exercise recommendations, improved adherence rates, and enhanced recovery efficiency. Discussion: This research provides a new direction in robotic-assisted rehabilitation, bridging the gap between sports science, intelligent systems, and urologic oncology recovery through interdisciplinary innovation and patient-centered design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper addresses the critical problem of inconsistent and non-adaptive performance benchmarking, which limits objective comparisons across players, teams, and historical data. We propose a novel data-driven framework leveraging machine learning (ML) to create an adaptive benchmarking system that automatically evaluates performance trends, identifies anomalies, and provides actionable insights. Our approach integrates deep learning, reinforcement learning, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale datasets, including biometrics, match statistics, and contextual variables. A key innovation is the hybrid ML pipeline combining supervised and unsupervised learning, where neural networks and clustering algorithms work together to dynamically rank and compare athlete performances based on evolving game conditions. Furthermore, we introduce anomaly detection and regression-based models to detect deviations from expected performance trends and offer personalized recommendations for training optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving superior accuracy in performance evaluation compared to conventional statistical methods. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to enhance transparency and ensure interpretability of model outputs for coaches, analysts, and athletes.

However, the high cost of commercial systems and the disturbing nature of wearable devices limit their accessibility and practicality. This study presents a two-fold solution: first, the development of a low-cost, non-intrusive optical motion capture system; and second, the implementation of a machine learning model to classify cricket batting shots based on body angle variations over time. After evaluating multiple optical techniques, MediaPipe was identified as the most effective and affordable solution. A system comprising four Logitech 720p cameras was deployed using Python multiprocessing to capture player motion in real time, ensuring efficient handling of both computational and input/output operations. Motion data collected from the system was analyzed to extract distinct angle variation patterns associated with different batting shots. These patterns were used to train a hybrid machine learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

	abstract = {Basketball games generate a great amount of data across various dimensions, including player performance, team dynamics, and game outcomes. This makes basketball an ideal field for data analysis. In this study, we build upon previous researches to explore the prediction of NBA game outcomes based on key performance metrics such as points, rebounds and assists. We used several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests, to assess their prediction ability. We also used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE to better understand the hidden structures of team performance. Our findings indicate that logistic regression with optimal regularization and random forest models achieved the highest accuracy and ROC AUC scores, demonstrating their potential for predicting win/loss outcomes. We also explored the impact of feature selection and hyperparameter, which provides valuable insights into our model's optimization. Although traditional machine learning techniques performed well, future research could add more performance factors, deal with imbalanced data, and explore deep learning approaches to further improve predictive accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Forecasting within signal processing pipelines is crucial for mitigating delays, particularly in predicting the dynamic movements of objects such as NBA players. This task poses significant challenges due to the inherently interactive and unpredictable nature of sports, where abrupt changes in velocity and direction are prevalent. Traditional approaches, including (S)ARIMA(X), Kalman filters (KF), and Particle filters (PF), often struggle to model the non-linear dynamics present in such scenarios. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers, offer greater flexibility and accuracy but frequently fail to explicitly capture the interplay between temporal dependencies and contextual interactions, which are critical in chaotic sports environments.In this paper, we evaluate these models and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results reveal key performance trade-offs across input history length, generalizability, and the ability to incorporate contextual information. ML-based methods demonstrated substantial improvements over linear models across forecast horizons of up to 2s. Among the tested architectures, our hybrid LSTM augmented with contextual information achieved the lowest final displacement error (FDE) of 1.51m, outperforming temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN), graph attention network (GAT), and Transformers, while also requiring less data and training time compared to GAT and Transformers. Our findings indicate that no single architecture excels across all metrics, emphasizing the need for task-specific considerations in trajectory prediction for fast-paced, dynamic environments such as NBA gameplay. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves the intentional destruction of one’s own body tissues without suicidal intent. Prior research has shown that individuals with NSSI exhibit abnormal pain perception; however, the pain-processing neural circuits underlying NSSI remain poorly understood. This study leverages graph neural networks to predict NSSI risk and examine the learned connectivity of neural underpinnings using multimodal data. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were collected from 50 patients with NSSI, 79 healthy controls (HC), and 44 patients with mental disorder who did not engage in NSSI as disease controls (DC). We constructed pain-related brain networks for each participant. An interpretable graph attention networks (GAT) model was developed, considering demographic factors, to predict NSSI risk and highlight NSSI-specific connectivity using learned attention matrices. Results: The proposed GAT model based on imaging data achieved an accuracy of 80%, and increased to 88% when self-reported pain scales were incorporated alongside imaging data in distinguishing patients with NSSI from HC. It highlighted amygdala-parahippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-insula connectivity as pivotal in NSSI-related pain processing. After incorporating imaging data of DC, the model’s accuracy reached 74%, underscoring consistent neural connectivity patterns. The GAT model demonstrates high predictive accuracy for NSSI, enhanced by including self-reported pain scales. Conclusions: Our proposed GAT model underscores the significance in the functional integration of limbic regions, paralimbic regions and IFG in NSSI pain processing. Our findings suggest altered pain processing as a key mechanism in NSSI, providing insights for potential neural modulation intervention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We aimed to develop a predictor of post-LT ARDS using machine learning (ML) methods. Data from 755 patients in the internal validation set and 115 patients in the external validation set were retrospectively reviewed, covering demographics, etiology, medical history, laboratory results, and perioperative data. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-value, the prediction performance of seven ML models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree, random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), naïve bayes (NB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were evaluated and compared with acute lung injury prediction scores (LIPS). 234 (30.99%) ARDS patients were diagnosed. The RF model had the best performance, with an AUROC of 0.766 (accuracy: 0.722, sensitivity: 0.617) in the internal validation set and a comparable AUROC of 0.844 (accuracy: 0.809, sensitivity: 0.750) in the external validation set. The performance of all ML models was better than LIPS (AUROC 0.692, 0.776). The predictor variables included the age of the recipient, BMI, MELD score, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, operation time, standard urine volume, total intake volume, and red blood cell infusion volume. We firstly developed a risk predictor of post-LT ARDS based on RF model to ameliorate clinical practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of football analytics has transformed how players are evaluated, strategies are developed, and recruitment processes are planned. Machine learning (ML) has become a vital tool in analyzing player performance, especially in identifying leading goal scorers and highly effective goalkeepers. This research focuses on understanding how team statistics influence goals and saves, examining not only individual player metrics but also the relationship between team attacks, team goals, and the impact of each player's threatening attacks on their goal-scoring output. Additionally, metrics related to goals conceded by the team were analyzed to establish any correlation with the number of saves made by goalkeepers. The study aims to predict the top goal scorer and the best goalkeeper using seven ML models: Random Forest, XG Boost, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting. Data was gathered through web scraping and API integration from five major leagues: La Liga, Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, and Serie A covering the seasons from 2017/2018 to 2022/2023. The models' performance was assessed using statistical measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-Squared (R<sup>2</sup>), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Findings indicate that XG Boost performed best for predicting goal scorers, while Linear Regression was most effective for forecasting goalkeeper saves.

	abstract = {This research offers the solution to the existing problem by implementing the idea of a unique athletic training based on predictive analytics and personalization algorithms. In particular, we suggest the use of the MLP-LSTM model to forecast athletic injuries and prescribe individualized workout schedules relevant to the specific athlete. Multilayer perceptron and long short-term memory network are used together for designing MLP-LSTM architecture that has the capacity to grasp temporal patterns present in athlete information and predict injuries. It will employ training data, athletes' profile, and data on their past and present injuries and using statistical and mathematical models to read into it and look for signs that may be precursors to possible injuries. Accordingly, individual training schedules are suggested with the intent to minimize the chances for sustaining an injury while at the same time maximize performance. The creation of this system appears to be fundamentally proactive with regards to athletic training because it puts it in the hands of the coaches and athletes involved to allow prevention of injuries when they are most likely to occur. Based on the experimental results, it can be concluded that MLP-LSTM outperforms most of the traditional machine learning classifiers for the injury prediction. Moreover, the workout routines created by the system have proved to enhance the athletes' performance and prevent injuries.

Advanced techniques for handling missing data points using combined object detection and 3D landmark extraction to track the batsman's move-ments are employed for efficiency. To enhance accuracy of the analysis, complex methods are used to deal with missing data. By integrating object detection methods with 3D land-mark extraction, effective tracking of batsman movements is captured.

	abstract = {Frequent injuries pose a problem in professional soccer that is being tackled with preventive measures. Consequently, injury prediction and prevention are also increasingly addressed from a statistical perspective. In a pilot study, several machine learning algorithms and conventional statistical approaches have been compared regarding their potential to predict time-loss non-contact lower-body injuries in professional youth soccer players, using data from a prospective cohort study with 56 players of which 22 were injured. The covariates considered here include basic soccer-related as well as neuromuscular and biomechanical features derived from physical testing. Lasso regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines are considered for binary classification and prediction of an injury occurrence. The prediction results from a cross-validated procedure are compared regarding multiple quality measures. Post Lasso logistic regression with a reduced penalty gives the best results with an accuracy of 0.625, a predictive likelihood of 0.593, and a Brier score of 0.228. The respective sensitivity and specificity are 0.773 and 0.529, with an AUC of 0.672. Moreover, an XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Lasso model in terms of accuracy (0.661), while for the other performance measures it is dominated by the Lasso. In addition to the specific results on the available injury data set, the proposed comparison procedure of several models for binary prediction provides a generally applicable analysis guideline. This roadmap can also be applied in other contexts where similarly structured small but rich data sets are available. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, research on machine learning in football has primarily focused on prediction. There is a need to explore whether machine learning can contribute to generating more in-depth and accurate insights into football analysis. This essay presents a descriptive analysis of player performance in football matches. Typically, player performance in football is evaluated by consulting a panel of experts, though the criteria they use for evaluation remain undisclosed. By applying machine learning algorithms and pruning techniques, several classifications were developed to identify the most critical functional attributes of players. The functional metrics that delivered the best results in rating predictions had an average error of 0.17. The most significant performance data for each position on the field were closely aligned with the factors experts consider when grading players. The 34 performance characteristics identified achieved a prediction accuracy of 63.4% for match outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our approach utilizes pose estimation using ViTPose for capturing player posture accurately while a shot is being played. The model takes an image as input, and accurately identifies the batsman. Keypoints obtained by applying the pre-trained ViTPose model on the input image is classified into one of four different shot categories. This finds application in sports analytics as well as smart bowling machines for continuous skill learning. The classification of cricket batting shots is difficult because of enormous variability in the techniques of players and their shot types. The existing methods do not have any feasible approach toward discrimination of different types of shots in dynamic environments. Therefore, this study meets the gap in the development of a robust automated system, which optimally categorizes cricket shots. This will be operationalized further using techniques such as pose estimation and object recognition, among many other machine learning and computer vision advancements, for the enhancement of shot classification in the realization of analytics and training applications in sports. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using data from six seasons (2018–2023) of the Women’s National Rugby League (NRLW), five machine learning algorithms generated two key metrics: “Wins Created” for offensive performance and “Losses Created” for defensive performance. These were adjusted by a situational importance modifier based on player positions and combined into a final metric called “Net Wins Added”. An Elo rating variant modified to suit a rugby league context was also created to provide a strength of opponent multiplier for player performance. The validity of these metrics against traditional objective and subjective performance measures in rugby league were evaluated. The metrics predicted seasonal team wins with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.9 and Player of the Year top 10 leaderboard points with an RMSE of 8.2. The metrics displayed substantial agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.82) when predicting experts’ Team of the Year award recipients and substantial agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.75) when predicting players’ Team of the Year awards. Developing and validating these objective player performance metrics provide women’s rugby league with a unique system to enhance talent evaluation and player recruitment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Upper extremity injuries in baseball players demand advanced prevention. Our study analyzed clinical features using machine learning techniques to provide precise and individualized injury risk assessment and prediction. We recruited 98 baseball players and collected data on glenohumeral internal/external rotation, posterior capsule thickness, supraspinatus tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance, and occupation ratio. Players were monitored for upper extremity injuries throughout a baseball season. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of these clinical variables using five models: Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and Support Vector Machine. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis was used to clarify each feature’s role in injury prediction. During the season, 28 players experienced injuries. CatBoost (accuracy: 0.70 ± 0.05; AUC: 0.66 ± 0.05) and logistic regression (accuracy: 0.63 ± 0.07; AUC: 0.64 ± 0.08) excelled in bootstrapped evaluations and performed well in independent tests, with CatBoost maintaining an accuracy of 0.70 and an AUC of 0.62. Including GIRD had a negligible effect on CatBoost’s accuracy. This integration with SHAP analyses enables a better understanding of each clinical feature’s role in predicting injuries, laying the foundation for personalized injury prevention strategies. With these novel approaches, overall and individualized injury prediction can be enhanced, and future research in sports medicine can be advanced. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this work is to develop a framework based on large language models (LLMs) to predict postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) outcomes in elderly patients. Impact Statement: Our study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to address the issues of poor generalization and weak interpretability commonly encountered in disease prediction using traditional machine learning (ML) models. Introduction: AKI is a severe postoperative complication, especially in elderly patients with declining renal function. Current AKI prediction models rely on ML, but their lack of interpretability and generalizability limits clinical use. LLMs, with extensive pretraining and text generation capabilities, offer a new solution. Methods: We applied prompt engineering and knowledge distillation based on instruction fine-tuning to optimize LLMs for AKI prediction. The framework was tested on 2,649 samples from 2 private Chinese hospitals and one public South Korean dataset, which were divided into internal and external datasets. Results: The LLM framework showed robust external performance, with accuracy rates: commercial LLMs (internal: 63.73%, external: 68.73%), open-source LLMs (internal: 63.70%, external: 64.24%), and ML models (internal: 63.93%, external: 58.27%). LLMs also provided human-readable explanations for better clinical understanding. Conclusion: The proposed framework showcases the potential of LLMs to enhance generalization and interpretability in postoperative AKI prediction, paving the way for more robust and transparent predictive solutions in clinical settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using a dataset of 12,840 photographs, the version's average accuracy is 95.32%. The high values show how efficiently the model can correctly identify and distinguish between various cricket shots. The overall accuracy of 98% is sustained by the model for all the classes but support values are: Pull with 2620 instances or 20%, Cover Drive with 2670 instances or 21%, Square Cut with 2710 instances or 21%, Straight Drive with 2720 instances or 21%, and Hook with 2120 instances or 17%. This balanced data naturally enhances the reliability of the model, while representing robust capability in dealing with variations in shot types. The novelty of this finding lies in the fact that the model can significantly enhance the value of cricket analytics, such as underlining useful insights that may be acquired from the performance of players and shot selections. This, in turn, can lead to an improvement of the training strategies for coaches and analysts as well as the enhancement of field decisions.

This study introduces a collaborative framework that leverages Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning for evaluating jump landings and predicting athletic readiness by modelling Countermovement Jumps (CMJs) biomechanical aspects. Seventeen female collegiate basketball athletes of Sacred Heart University (SHU), CT, USA, participated in weekly CMJs over a 26-week season. Through CV-driven semantic analysis of videos, the framework identifies the crucial initial contact and maximum flexion point during jump landings and extracts kinetic and kinematic features of the lower extremities. Next, an inferential analysis is conducted to understand the relationship between these features and the CMJ-driven reactive strength index modified (RSI<inf>mod</inf>) score, which measures fatigue and athletic readiness. An XGBoost regressor, trained on the past week’s data, then predicted the RSI<inf>mod</inf> score for the following week, which resulted in an MSE of 0.020 and an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.892. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the framework offers interpretable feedback, aiding coaches in creating personalised training programs and optimising athletic performance while minimising injury risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel framework for soccer game prediction using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, initially focusing on the Dutch Eredivisie League and later expanding to include the Scottish Premiership and the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. The methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and testing. Various models are evaluated, including enhanced versions of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Network, and Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network. Unlike existing studies that focus on end-of-game features, this research incorporates real-time features like half-time results and goals for in-game decision-making. Advanced data normalization and sampling methods, such as SVM-SMOTE and Near-Miss, are applied to improve model performance. Models are assessed using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area under the ROC Curve. Results indicate that the Feedforward Neural Network excels in predicting game results, while Logistic Regression is best for predicting under and over 2.5 goals. The integration of Random Forest and XGBoost in a voting model consistently achieves the highest accuracy across both prediction tasks. The combined use of data from the three leagues further validates the models’ robustness and generalizability. This study demonstrates the potential of machine and deep learning to enhance soccer game predictions through advanced techniques and comprehensive data analysis, making significant contributions to sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soccer attracts the attention of many researchers and professionals in the sports industry. Therefore, the incorporation of science into the sport is constantly growing, with increasing investments in performance analysis and sports prediction industries. This study aims to (i) highlight the use of complex networks as an alternative tool for predicting soccer match outcomes and (ii) show how the combination of structural analysis of passing networks with match statistical data can provide deeper insights into the game patterns and strategies used by teams. In order to do so, complex network metrics and match statistics were used to build machine learning models that predict the wins and losses of soccer teams in different leagues. The results showed that models based on passing networks were as effective as 'traditional' models, which use general match statistics. Another finding was that by combining both approaches, more accurate models were obtained than when they were used separately, demonstrating that the fusion of such approaches can offer a deeper understanding of game patterns, allowing the comprehension of tactics employed by teams relationships between players, their positions and interactions during matches. It is worth mentioning that both network metrics and match statistics were important and impactful for the mixed model. Furthermore, the use of networks with a lower granularity of temporal evolution (such as creating a network for each half of the match) performed better than a single network for the entire game. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Surgical specialists experience significant musculoskeletal strain as a consequence of their profession, a domain within the healthcare system often recognized for the pronounced impact of such issues. The aim of this study is to calculate the risk of presenting musculoskeletal injuries in surgeons after surgical practice. Methods: Cross-sectional study carried out using an online form (12/2021–03/2022) aimed at members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons. Demographic variables on physical and professional activity were recorded, as well as musculoskeletal pain (MSP) associated with surgical activity. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to identify risk factors associated with the development of MSP based on personalized surgical activity. To achieve this, a risk algorithm was computed and an online machine learning calculator was created to predict them. Physiotherapeutic recommendations were generated to address and alleviate each MSP. Results: A total of 651 surgeons (112 trainees, 539 specialists). 90.6% reported MSP related to surgical practice, 60% needed any therapeutic measure and 11.7% required a medical leave. In the long term, MSP was most common in the cervical and lumbar regions (52.4, 58.5%, respectively). Statistically significant risk factors (OR CI 95%) were for trunk pain, long interventions without breaks (3.02, 1.65–5.54). Obesity, indicated by BMI, to lumbar pain (4.36, 1.84–12.1), while an inappropriate laparoscopic screen location was associated with cervical and trunk pain (1.95, 1.28–2.98 and 2.16, 1.37–3.44, respectively). A predictive model and an online calculator were developed to assess MSP risk. Furthermore, a need for enhanced ergonomics training was identified by 89.6% of surgeons. Conclusions: The prevalence of MSP among surgeons is a prevalent but often overlooked health concern. Implementing a risk calculator could enable tailored prevention strategies, addressing modifiable factors like ergonomics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A multi-objective optimization method based on an injury prediction model is proposed to address the increasingly prominent safety issues for e-bike riders in Chinese road traffic. This method aims to enhance the protective effect of vehicle front-end for e-bike riders by encompassing a broader range of test scenarios. Initially, large-scale rider injury response data were collected using automated Madymo simulations. A machine learning model was then trained to accurately predict the risk of rider injury under varied crash conditions. Subsequently, this model was integrated into a multi-objective optimization framework, combined with multi-criteria decision analysis, to effectively evaluate and rank various design alternatives on the Pareto frontier. This process entailed a comparative analysis of the design in a baseline scenario before and after optimization, focusing on both kinematic and injury responses of riders. Through detailed injury mechanism analysis, key design variables such as the height of the hood front and the width of the bumper were identified. This led to the proposal of specific optimization strategies for these structural parameters. The results from this study demonstrate that the proposed optimization method not only guides the design process accurately and efficiently but also balances the injury risks across different body parts. This approach significantly reduces the injury risk for riders in car-to-e-bike collisions and provides actionable insights for vehicle design enhancements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable tool in various fields of human activity, including action recognition. With the advancements in machine learning and deep learning technologies, AI's capabilities in analyzing and interpreting actions performed by humans or objects in video and audio recordings have significantly increased. This progress has led to the development of numerous applications such as surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, sports analytics, and autonomous driving, where understanding and recognizing actions is crucial. Traditional methods of action recognition relied heavily on handcrafted features and classical machine learning algorithms, which often struggled with the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The emergence of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), has revolutionized this field by enabling models to learn hierarchical representations directly from raw data, thus improving performance and robustness.

	abstract = {In the dynamic realm of golf, where every swing can make the difference between victory and defeat, the strategic selection of golf clubs has become a crucial factor in determining the outcome of a game. Advancements in artificial intelligence have opened new avenues for enhancing the decision-making process, empowering golfers to achieve optimal performance on the course. In this paper, we introduce an AI-based game planning system that assists players in selecting the best club for a given scenario. The system considers factors such as distance, terrain, wind strength and direction, and quality of lie. A rule-based model provides the four best club options based on the player’s maximum shot data for each club. The player picks a club, shot, and target and a probabilistic classification model identifies whether the shot represents a birdie opportunity, par zone, bogey zone, or worse. The results of our model show that taking into account factors such as terrain and atmospheric features increases the likelihood of a better shot outcome. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Featured Application: The information obtained from this study can be useful for coaches and performance analysts of teams. By taking into account the factors that contribute to securing one of the top positions in the league standings, coaches are encouraged to adopt ball possession strategies with patience and short passes to create gaps in the opponent’s defense and, at the right moment, execute through balls aiming to enter the attacking third and create goal opportunities. On the other hand, teams are advised to avoid long passes, as these may lead to a loss of team cohesion and create large distances between the lines. Finally, this information is also useful for team scouts in identifying players who are suitable for implementing the aforementioned strategies. Introduction: Performance analysis is essential for coaches and a topic of extensive research. The advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has revolutionized sports analytics. Aim: The primary aim of this article is to present a robust, explainable machine learning (ML) model that identifies the key factors that contribute to securing one of the top three positions in the standings of the French Ligue 1, ensuring participation in the UEFA Champions League for the following season. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from all 380 matches of the 2022–23 French Ligue 1 season. The data were obtained from the publicly-accessed website “whoscored” and included 34 performance indicators. This study employed Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) and various ML algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to create a robust, explainable model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) model was used to enhance model interpretability. Results: The K-means Cluster Analysis categorized teams into groups (TOP TEAMS, 3 teams/REST TEAMS, 17 teams), and the ML models provided significant insights into the factors influencing league standings. The LR classifier was the best-performing classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75.13%, a recall of 76.32%, an F1-score of 48.03%, and a precision of 35.17%. “SHORT PASSES” and “THROUGH BALLS” were features found to positively influence the model’s predictions, while “TACKLES ATTEMPTED” and “LONG BALLS” had a negative impact. Conclusions: Our model provided satisfactory predictive accuracy and clear interpretability of results, which gave useful information to stakeholders. Specifically, our model suggests adopting a strategy during the ball possession phase that relies on short passes (avoiding long ones) and aiming to enter the attacking third and the opponent’s penalty area with through balls. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

By employing advanced data science techniques, we aim to identify key factors that enhance winning probabilities during these critical moments. The study introduces the Estimation of Clutch Competency (EoCC) metric, which is a novel formula designed to evaluate players’ impact under pressure. Examining player performance statistics over twenty seasons, this research addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the quantification of clutch moments and challenges conventional wisdom in basketball analytics. Our findings deal valuable insights into player efficiency during the final minutes and its impact on the probabilities of a positive outcome. The EoCC metric’s validation through comparison with the NBA Clutch Player of the Year voting results demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying top performers in high-pressure situations. Leveraging state-of-the-art data science techniques and algorithms, this study analyzes play data to uncover key factors contributing to a team’s success in pivotal moments. This research not only enhances the theoretical understanding of clutch dynamics but also provides practical insights for coaches, analysts, and the broader sports community. It contributes to more informed decision making in high-stakes basketball environments, advancing the field of sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The field of sports analytics has grown rapidly, with a primary focus on performance forecasting, enhancing the understanding of player capabilities, and indirectly benefiting team strategies and player development. This work aims to forecast and comparatively evaluate players’ goal-scoring likelihood in four elite football leagues (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Serie A) by mining advanced statistics from 2017 to 2023. Six types of machine learning (ML) models were developed and tested individually through experiments on the comprehensive datasets collected for these leagues. We also tested the upper 30th percentile of the best-performing players based on their performance in the last season, with varied features evaluated to enhance prediction accuracy in distinct scenarios. The results offer insights into the forecasting abilities of those leagues, identifying the best forecasting methodologies and the factors that most significantly contribute to the prediction of players’ goal-scoring. XGBoost consistently outperformed other models in most experiments, yielding the most accurate results and leading to a well-generalized model. Notably, when applied to Serie A, it achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.29.

	abstract = {Introduction: Computational head injury models are promising tools for understanding and predicting traumatic brain injuries. However, most available head injury models are "average"models that employ a single set of head geometry (e.g., 50th-percentile U.S. male) without considering variability in these parameters across the human population. A significant variability of head shapes exists in U.S. Army soldiers, evident from the Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Army Personnel (ANSUR II). The objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of head shape on the predicted risk of traumatic brain injury from computational head injury models. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 25 human subjects are collected. These images are registered to the standard MNI152 brain atlas, and the resulting transformation matrix components (called head shape parameters) are used to quantify head shapes of the subjects. A generative machine learning model is used to generate 25 additional head shape parameter datasets to augment our database. Head injury models are developed for these head shapes, and a rapid injurious head rotation event is simulated to obtain several brain injury predictor variables (BIPVs): Peak cumulative maximum principal strain (CMPS), average CMPS, and the volume fraction of brain exceeding an injurious CMPS threshold. A Gaussian process regression model is trained between head shape parameters and BIPVs, which is then used to study the relative sensitivity of the various BIPVs on individual head shape parameters. We distinguish head shape parameters into 2 types: Scaling components,, and that capture the breadth, length, and height of the head, respectively, and shearing components (, and) that capture the relative skewness of the head shape. Results: An overall positive correlation is evident between scaling components and BIPVs. Notably, a very high, positive correlation is seen between the BIPVs and the head volume. As an example, a 57% increase in peak CMPS was noted between the smallest and the largest investigated head volume parameters. The variation in shearing components, and on average does not cause notable changes in the BIPVs. From the Gaussian process regression model, all 3 BIPVs showed an increasing trend with each of the 3 scaling components, but the BIPVs are found to be most sensitive to the height dimension of the head. From the Sobol sensitivity analysis, the scaling parameter contributes nearly 60% to the total variance in peak and average CMPS; contributes approximately 20%, whereas contributes less than 5%. The remaining contribution is from the 6 shearing components. Unlike peak and average CMPS, the VF-CMPS BIPV is associated with relatively evenly distributed Sobol indices across the 3 scaling parameters. Furthermore, the contribution of shearing components on the total variance in this case is negligible. Conclusions: Head shape has a considerable influence on the injury predictions of computational head injury models. Available "average"head injury models based on a 50th-percentile U.S. male are likely associated with considerable uncertainty. In general, larger head sizes correspond to greater BIPV magnitudes, which point to potentially a greater injury risk under rapid neck rotation for people with larger heads. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There has been an explosion of data collected about sports. Because such data is extremely rich and complex, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Designing these indicators requires paying careful attention to a number of subtle issues from a methodological and evaluation perspective. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for handling them. Methodologically, we highlight that dependencies affect how to perform data partitioning for evaluation as well as the need to consider contextual factors. From an evaluation perspective, we draw a distinction between evaluating the developed indicators themselves versus the underlying models that power them. We argue that both aspects must be considered, but that they require different approaches. We hope that this article helps bridge the gap between traditional sports expertise and modern data analytics by providing a structured framework with practical examples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite ongoing efforts, the relationship between groin strength and injury remains unclear. The challenge of accurately predicting injuries presents an opportunity for researchers to develop prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence of such injuries. Consequently, this issue requires further investigation to obtain insights into effective mitigation strategies. In 120 male soccer players, the maximum isometric strength of the hip muscle groups was measured, and the strength ratios were calculated. Previous injury and anthropometric data were registered. Injury data were collected following the FIFA/UEFA consensus. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) was used to predict the incidence of injury, while the significant predictive variables of the k-NN algorithm were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model (LR) to analyze the likelihood of players sustaining a groin injury. The LR model determined two variables as significant predictors of groin injury. Players were less likely to sustain a groin injury by 76% for each decrease of the adductor/abductor isometric strength ratio in the non-dominant limb (OR = 0.238, CI 95% = [(0.098–0.572]). Players with a history of previous injury had a 67% greater risk of sustaining an injury (OR = 0.333, CI 95% = [(0.1068–1.038]). Isometric hip adductor and abductor strength imbalances of the non-dominant lower limb and a history of previous injury were risk factors for groin injury in soccer players. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purposes of this study were to develop a prediction model for pressure injury using a machine learning algorithm and to integrate it into clinical practice. Methods: This was a retrospective study of tertiary hospitals in Seoul, Korea. It analyzed patients in 12 departments where many pressure injuries occurred, including 8 general wards and 4 intensive care units from January 2018 to May 2022. In total, 182 variables were included in the model development. A pressure injury prediction model was developed using the gradient boosting algorithm, logistic regression, and decision tree methods, and it was compared to the Braden scale. Results: Among the 1, 389, 660 general ward cases, there were 451 cases of pressure injuries, and among 139, 897 intensive care unit cases, there were 297 cases of pressure injuries. Among the tested prediction models, the gradient boosting algorithm showed the highest predictive performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the gradient boosting algorithm’s pressure injury prediction model in the general ward and intensive care unit was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.83~0.89) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.79~0.87), respectively. This model was integrated into the electronic health record system to show each patient’s probability for pressure injury occurrence, and the risk factors calculated every hour. Conclusion: The prediction model developed using the gradient boosting algorithm exhibited higher performance than the Braden scale. A clinical decision support system that automatically assesses pressure injury risk allows nurses to focus on patients at high risk for pressure injuries without increasing their workload. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study explores the use of reported data and predictive analysis as a long-term generative approach for athlete training planning. The data collected from 607 higher education students (mean age = 16.86; Std = 1.22), includes measurements from physical tests and activity records. The dataset comprises 29 variables, which were profiled and feature-engineered to enhance predictive accuracy for training procedures. We leveraged Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to determine the significance of features on outcomes and utilized Power BI to visualize the impact of aggregate features on running distance. Initial findings indicates that the optimal age range for focusing training efforts is between 16 and 17 years old. This result is supported by a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.42, stipulating a moderate positive relationship between the age group and the predicted performance outcomes based on key aggregate features. In particular, four key features significantly impact performance, while other variables have a minor influence. The study highlights the significance of these aggregate features in predicting training success. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of a robust reporting process and the use of predictive analysis in developing training programs. It identifies four critical features that have a substantial impact on realized performance. While these four features are paramount, the study also acknowledges that other variables, though less influential, may still affect the outcomes if considered. This comprehensive approach to data collection and analysis provides a solid foundation for optimizing athlete training programs, ensuring that training efforts are both targeted and effective.

	abstract = {Motivation: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome that affects a large fraction of all critically ill patients, and early diagnosis to receive adequate treatment is as imperative as it is challenging to make early. Consequently, machine learning approaches have been developed to predict AKI ahead of time. However, the prevalence of AKI is often underestimated in state-of-the-art approaches, as they rely on an AKI event annotation solely based on creatinine, ignoring urine output. We construct and evaluate early warning systems for AKI in a multi-disciplinary ICU setting, using the complete KDIGO definition of AKI. We propose several variants of gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)-based models, including a novel time-stacking based approach. A state-of-the-art LSTM-based model previously proposed for AKI prediction is used as a comparison, which was not specifically evaluated in ICU settings yet. Results: We find that optimal performance is achieved by using GBDT with the time-based stacking technique (AUPRC 65.7%, compared with the LSTM-based model's AUPRC 62.6%), which is motivated by the high relevance of time since ICU admission for this task. Both models show mildly reduced performance in the limited training data setting, perform fairly across different subcohorts, and exhibit no issues in gender transfer. Following the official KDIGO definition substantially increases the number of annotated AKI events. In our study GBDTs outperform LSTM models for AKI prediction. Generally, we find that both model types are robust in a variety of challenging settings arising for ICU data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study utilized machine learning methods to build predictive models using a comprehensive CrossFit (CF) dataset, aiming to reveal valuable insights into the factors influencing performance and emerging trends. METHODS: Random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to predict performance in four key weightlifting exercises within CF: clean and jerk, snatch, back squat, and deadlift. Performance was evaluated using R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>) values and mean squared error (MSE). Feature importance analysis was conducted using RF, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models. RESULTS: The RF model excelled in deadlift performance prediction (R<sup>2</sup>=0.80), while the MLR model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in clean and jerk (R<sup>2</sup>=0.93). Across exercises, clean and jerk consistently emerged as a crucial predictor. The feature importance analysis revealed intricate relationships among exercises, with gender significantly impacting deadlift performance. CONCLUSIONS: This research advances our understanding of performance prediction in CF through machine learning techniques. It provides actionable insights for practitioners, optimize performance, and demonstrates the potential for future advancements in data-driven sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the performance metrics that underpin team success in the dynamic professional basketball world is crucial. This study originated in the context of increasing academic and professional interest in performance analytics, focusing on how teams in elite leagues, such as the Euroleague and their respective national leagues, adapt and perform based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs). Purpose: The primary objective of this research is to bridge the existing bibliographic gap by comparing the effectiveness of various KPIs in predicting match outcomes in both the Euroleague and National Basketball Leagues. This comparison aims to identify how strategic adaptations and performance measures differ according to the unique demands and styles of the respective competitions. Methodology: The study utilized two main datasets: One encompassing all Euroleague 2022–23 matches and the other compiling cumulative statistics from Euroleague teams over three seasons. Machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, were employed along with the Boruta algorithm for feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for the interpretability of the model output. Results: The analysis identified that certain KPIs, such as the effective field goal percentage, defensive ratings, and assists-to-turnover ratio, vary significantly in their impact on game outcomes between Euroleague and National League games. These variations imply that teams may need to tailor their strategies depending on the league in which they play. Conclusions: This study significantly advances the field of sports analytics by providing a detailed comparative analysis of basketball performance metrics across two competitive settings. It offers practical insights that can help coaches and analysts optimize team performance and strategic planning. Moreover, sophisticated data analysis techniques have allowed for a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that influence basketball game outcomes, thereby making a significant contribution to the literature and practice of sports performance analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this study, a dance sports and injury monitoring system (DIMS) based on a recyclable flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (RF-TENG) sensor module, a data processing hardware module, and an upper computer intelligent analysis module are developed to promote intelligent motion. The resultant RF-TENG exhibits an ultra-fast response time of 17 ms, coupled with robust stability demonstrated over 4200 operational cycles, with 6% variation in output voltage. The DIMS enables immersive training by providing visual feedback on sports status and interacting with virtual games.

	abstract = {The on-board emergency call system with accurate occupant injury prediction can help rescuers deliver more targeted traffic accident rescue and save more lives. We use machine learning methods to establish, train, and validate a number of classification models that can predict occupant injuries (by determining whether the MAIS (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale) level is greater than 2) based on crash data, and ranked the correlation of some factors affecting vehicle occupant injury levels in accidents. The optimal model was selected by the model prediction accuracy, and the Grid Search method was used to optimize the hyper-parameters for the model. The model is based on 2799 two-vehicle collision accident data from NHTSA CISS (The Crash Investigation Sampling System of NHTSA) traffic accident database.The results show that the model achieves high-precision prediction of occupant injury MAIS level (recall rate 0.8718, AUC(Area under Curve) 0.8579) without excluding vehicle model, and the top 8 relevant features given by the model are: lateral speed change, occupant age, longitudinal speed change, seat belt usage, occupant gender, lateral speed change direction, airbag trigger, and longitudinal speed change direction. We believe that this method can be used to complete organ-level post-crash injury prediction after adding more features, which has great potential to improve the efficiency of traffic accident rescue and reduce the casualty rate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In elite sports, athletic excellence demands meticulous performance preparation and a sound health status. This paper overviews the current propositions and applications of pervasive computing and data analytics and our vision on how they should be used in future frameworks to contribute to the optimal balance of athletes’ performance and health requirements. Two main areas will be discussed. The first area is Sports Performance Optimization, in which we consider interesting recent advancements in data analytics for performance improvement, equipment design, and team member recruitment and selection. We will also briefly discuss how the betting industry has been relaying and developing sports analytics. The second area is Athlete’s Wellness and Wellbeing, which will discuss how wearables and data analytics have been used to assess physical activity and sedentary behavior profiles, sleep and circadian rhythm, nutrition and eating behavior, menstrual cycles, and training/performance readiness. In the final part of this paper, we argue that a critical issue for managers to enhance their decision making is the standardization of acquired information and decision-making processes, while introducing an adaptable, personalized approach. Thus, we present and discuss new theoretical and practical approaches that could potentially address this problem and identify precision medicine as a recommended methodology. This conceptualization involves the integration of pervasive computing and data analytics by employing predictive models that are constantly updated with the outcomes from monitoring tools and athletes’ feedback interventions. This framework has the potential to revolutionize how athletes’ performance and well-being are monitored, assessed, and optimized, contributing to a new era of precision in sports science and medicine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Female National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-I athlete injury prediction by vertical countermovement jump force-time metrics. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 783-786, 2024 - Vertical countermovement jump (CMJ) assessments on force plates have been purported to screen for musculoskeletal injury risk (MSKI) but with little scientific support. Thus, this study aimed to identify associations and noncontact lower-body injury predictability with CMJ force-time metrics in female athletes. The study entailed a retrospective analysis of routine injury and performance monitoring from 155 female National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I athletes. Noncontact lower-body injuries included in analysis were confirmed by medical staff, occurred during competition or training, resulted in time loss from training, and occurred within 3 months following CMJ testing (2 maximal effort, no arm swing, jumps on dual force plates). A total of 44 injuries occurred within 3 months following CMJ baseline testing and resulted in an average of 24.5 missed days from training. Those who sustained an injury were more likely to sustain another injury (15 of 44 injuries [33.1%]; odds ratio = 3.05 [95% CI = 1.31-6.99]). For every 1-unit increase from the mean in eccentric mean power and minimum eccentric force, there was a decrease in odds of sustaining a MSKI. Despite high overall model accuracy (85.6%), the receiving operating characteristic area under the curve (65.9%) was unacceptable and the true positive rate (recall) was 0.0%. Thus, no injuries in the testing data set were correctly classified by the logistic regression model with CMJ force-time metrics as predictors. Baseline CMJ assessment may not be useful for noncontact lower-body musculoskeletal injury screening or predictability in National Collegiate Athletics Association female athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: While many falls are preventable, they remain a leading cause of injury and death in older adults. Primary care clinics largely rely on screening questionnaires to identify people at risk of falls. Limitations of standard fall risk screening questionnaires include suboptimal accuracy, missing data, and non-standard formats, which hinder early identification of risk and prevention of fall injury. We used machine learning methods to develop and evaluate electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to identify older adults at risk of fall-related injuries in a primary care population and compared this approach to standard fall screening questionnaires. Methods: Using patient-level clinical data from an integrated healthcare system consisting of 16-member institutions, we conducted a case–control study to develop and evaluate prediction models for fall-related injuries in older adults. Questionnaire-derived prediction with three questions from a commonly used fall risk screening tool was evaluated. We then developed four temporal machine learning models using routinely available longitudinal EHR data to predict the future risk of fall injury. We also developed a fall injury-prevention clinical decision support (CDS) implementation prototype to link preventative interventions to patient-specific fall injury risk factors. Results: Questionnaire-based risk screening achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) up to 0.59 with 23% to 33% similarity for each pair of three fall injury screening questions. EHR-based machine learning risk screening showed significantly improved performance (best AUROC = 0.76), with similar prediction performance between 6-month and one-year prediction models. Conclusions: The current method of questionnaire-based fall risk screening of older adults is suboptimal with redundant items, inadequate precision, and no linkage to prevention. A machine learning fall injury prediction method can accurately predict risk with superior sensitivity while freeing up clinical time for initiating personalized fall prevention interventions. The developed algorithm and data science pipeline can impact routine primary care fall prevention practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, in the present era, statistical analysis and machine learning are used in place of conventional methods of sports analytics in commercial sports such as Cricket, Football, etc. This study intends to analyze correlations for features of accumulated online datasets and to make predictions for the team and player performance using correlated features by using statistical machine learning approaches. The suggested methodology includes feature extraction, correlation identification, and implementing appropriate machine learning approaches. Initially, the parameters of the Kabaddi game concerns such as the impact of tosses, cards, and home ground on results were analysed. Subsequently, based on team and player data correlation and cluster analysis, important characteristics were identified and appropriate rank-based scoring was established. Finally, the regression-based prediction was suggested with an r2 score and a cross-validation score greater than 0.91 with the least errors. Finally, a trained machine-learning model with greater outcomes was suggested by verifying the parameters that were analysed.

	abstract = {Using automated data analysis to understand what makes a play successful in football can enable teams to make data-driven decisions that may enhance their performance throughout the season. Analyzing different types of plays (e.g., corner, penalty, free kicks) requires different considerations. This work focuses on the analysis of corner kick plays. However, the central ideas apply to analyzing all types of plays. While prior analyses (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) have explored the link between contextual factors (e.g., match period, type of defensive marking) and the level of success of a corner kick (e.g., shot, shot on goal, goal), there has been no attempt to combine spatiotemporal event data (sequences of ball movements through the field) and contextual information to determine when and how (strategy) a particular type of corner kick play (tactic) is more likely to succeed or not. To address this gap, we propose an approach that (1) transforms spatiotemporal data into an alternative representation suitable for mining sequential patterns, (2) identifies and characterizes the sequential patterns used by offensive teams to move the ball toward the scoring zone (tactics), and (3) extracts contrast patterns to identify under what conditions different tactics result in increased chances of success or failure; we call these conditions strategies. Our results suggest that favorable and unfavorable conditions for tactic application are not the same across different tactics, supporting the argument that there is a benefit in performing an analysis that treats different tactics separately, where spatiotemporal information plays a crucial role. Unlike prior works on the corner kick, our approach can capture how the interaction between multiple contextual factors impacts the outcome of a corner kick. At the same time, the results can be explained to others in natural languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a binary classification model aimed at predicting whether a football player is best suited for an offensive or defensive position based on their skill set. The study addresses the challenges in precisely projecting a player's future potential solely from their skills, a gap in sports analytics and player evaluation research. Leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, the model aims to classify players into their optimal position groups, contributing to talent identification and recruitment strategies in football. Evaluation metrics demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict player positions, with a slight improvement observed in the enhanced model. However, the increase in model complexity does not yield significant performance gains, emphasizing the importance of balancing complexity with performance improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The primary objective is to develop a Convolution Neural Network-based real-time athlete score prediction system that outperforms RNNs in terms of accuracy. The work attempts to provide more precise and timely forecasts, which are crucial for efficient sports analytics, by utilizing the spatial nuances seen in athlete score photographs. We compiled a diverse collection of annotated athlete score photos from several sports settings in an effort to achieve real-time athlete score prediction. We designed an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, and adapted it for the extraction of spatial features. The Convolution Neural Network was carefully trained with the Adam optimisation method, and its accuracy and loss metrics were continuously monitored. A comprehensive comparison study utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) evaluated important performance metrics such as precision, computational effectiveness, and instantaneous inference capabilities. Convolution Neural Network is a powerful tool for improving real-time sports analytics. This was demonstrated by the integration of the trained Convolution Neural Network model into a real-time athlete scoring system, which involved optimizing processing pipelines for low-latency performance without sacrificing prediction accuracy. The Convolution Neural Network based feature extraction technique has better accuracy of 89.28% than the Recurrent Neural Network with 79.41 %. The statistical significance value obtained is 0.760 (p>0.05),hence it is observed that there is no statistical significant difference between the two groups. The sample records were measured with the help of clinical analysis, the value of alpha is 0.05, the value of beta is 0.5, percentage of confidence is 95. Convolutional Neural Network algorithms provided better results in Athlete Score Prediction than Recurrent Neural Network algorithms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The National Basketball Association (NBA) values regular-season success and acknowledges the crucial role of a team's roster composition in determining overall performance. This study uses machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning clustering and decision tree models, to predict the composition of a winning roster. Our research identified three distinct clusters based on win percentage and the distribution of players across different skill levels. Successful teams typically have more top-tier players and a significant representation of players in the lowest skill level. In contrast, teams that spread their talent across the entire roster are less successful. We have noticed that players with average to above-average skills are notably affected by excessive playing time in the previous game, which leads to decreased performance and potential losses for the team in the next game. Considering the time of year and the gap between games, we recommend prioritizing the rest and recovery of top players, especially in the latter half of the season. It's crucial to ensure that players who are not as skilled as the top players but still make significant contributions to the team maintain consistent performance, especially during the first half of the season. Analyzing height's impact on basketball player performance has revealed practical insights that can empower coaches and management. We found that the shortest and tallest players often perform less than those of average height. Most top performers in the NBA tend to have heights closer to the average. However, for players who frequently operate near the net and encounter numerous rebound opportunities, it is generally preferable to have an average or taller player for slightly enhanced overall performance compared to below-average height players. Teams can use these insights to improve their roster construction and maximize player utilization by coaches from one game to the next. This research provides practical strategies that can be immediately implemented to enhance team performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Shot identification or classification is based on the manual method which prone to error and time consuming. For improving the performance and coaching the cricket players, this paper purpose a system which can detect the shots for different games. In this research, by using advanced algorithm properties for analyzing the player movements and shot patter, the authors propose an automated shot detection and classifying model that provide a data driven way for highlighting the cricket performance. Moreover, it responds to the perpetual challenges in terms of the lack of access to high-quality data and elevated costs that current systems present. Such a solution can be scaled and utilized at various levels of the sport. The system's real-time classification feature that can be linked to broadcasts has the potential of creating a more in-depth understanding of players' performance, which may attract more spectators to the sport, as they would have a chance to differentiate between different types of shots.

In order to identify areas for improvement and potential injury risks, this proposed work aims to utilize the potential of AI techniques, such as XGBoost, to evaluate extensive player data, including movement patterns, biomechanics, and physical condition. This strategy is unusual because it combines real-time feedback systems with AI-powered predictive modeling to offer athletes and coaches individualized training advice and early warnings about potential injury risks. Cleaning and normalization were done during the preparation phase to make sure the data was suitable for analysis. Utilizing XGBoost for feature extraction allowed for the identification of critical factors affecting efficiency and injury risk. In sports analytics, the suggested XGBoost-AI system was compared to other AI-based techniques for improving performance and avoiding injuries. The study's findings show that the XGBoost classifier significantly improves performance accuracy, which may reach 96%. This is in contrast to conventional approaches that depend on subjective evaluations and human data analysis, which can result in errors and inefficiencies. Python is used to implement the suggested work.

	abstract = {Data analytics converts raw data into actionable insights. Sports analytics is pivotal in developing strategies and preparing players to achieve their best performance. It is especially important for team sports. However, gathering game data from previous game video recordings for sport analytics is time-consuming and tedious for coaches and their assistants. It could take them hours or days to sift through video clips to gather relevant information to prepare for their next game. This manual process called”tagging” in American football is essential to game planning for coaches. Automating this manual process can provide great benefits for teams in reducing the effort for data gathering and increasing the time for practice. Particularly, being able to automatically classify the offensive play formation for each play is crucial for developing game plans. This paper reports on our feasibility study on using machine learning techniques to automate the manual process. We studied offensive play formations extensively and devised an data augmentation strategy to generate realistic data for training and testing of our neural network. Using these synthetic data for training and testing, our neural network achieves an accuracy of 100% in recognizing 25 commonly used play formations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global appeal of football is fueled by its exhilarating dynamic and unpredictable nature. Football match prediction is still a challenging issue due to its growing interest. The accurate prediction of football match outcomes has been a topic of significant interest for various stakeholders, including coaches, analysts, and fans. This study explored the use of dimensionality reduction methods and different machine learning models to predict the results of football matches. A historical dataset was created from La Liga matches spanning four seasons, incorporating both technical and tactical actions for each match and both teams, comprising 297 features per match. Most important attributes are chosen from the feature set using various feature selection techniques including Pearson Correlation, Spearman's Rank Correlation, ANOVA F Test, and Random Forest. For prediction, a variety of classification techniques including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are used. The combination of the ANOVA F Test feature selection technique and the Random Forest classification method outperformed other models achieving an accuracy of 64.78% with 22 selected features when applied to an independent test set. This paper advances the field of match result prediction research by demonstrating how several machine learning classifiers and dimensionality reduction approaches can accurately predict the outcome of a football match. The suggested methodology can be expanded to other sports or high-dimensional data domains, and it has potential applications in sports analytics and team management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We named this feature the resource factor. We used linear regression, polynomial regression, elastic net regression, Xgboost, and random forest and found that random forest works best for our dataset.

Our results show that the Keras-Mediapipe model outperforms the YOLO-NAS model in shot classification, however, still requires further improvements to be applicable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global appeal and competitive nature of soccer have led to the application of technology to monitor and enhance player training and performance. Effective and data-driven training can reduce injury related to over-exertion and boost player performance. Shooting is a crucial skill in soccer and can significantly influence the outcome of a game. This work addresses the lack of a smart and privacy-aware device to track and analyze players' shot localization accuracy, particularly for amateur players. We investigate a smart soccer net that can localize the point of impact of the ball from the perturbations of small inertial measuring sensors attached to the net. We train a feedforward neural network with raw data and statistical-based features, and a convolutional neural network with time- and frequency-based features from continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Also, we investigated one, two, three, and four sensors deployed in selected configurations on the net. Four sensors deployed in a rhombus configuration and a model trained with CWT-based features achieved the best classification accuracy of 94 %. A cost-effective option of using three sensors in an inverted triangle configuration and the model trained with statistical-based features achieved 90 % accuracy. This work is a step towards a minimalistic system that can be used as a training aid to automatically track the positions of soccer player shots in the goal during training sessions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Early prediction of injury risk is crucial for implementing effective prevention strategies. Incorporating biomechanics, this study focuses on basketball players at a university in Xi’an, China, aiming to develop a machine learning-based model to predict joint injury risk using easily collectable data such as training load, fatigue levels, and previous injury history. Considering regional differences, we observed that local and northern Chinese students are generally taller, while students from southern China are typically shorter. This anthropometric variation was included in our sampling and analysis. Utilizing data from 100 basketball players, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the best predictive performance with an accuracy of 85%. Key risk factors identified include high training load, elevated subjective fatigue scores, and a history of previous joint injuries. Additionally, biomechanical data were integrated to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of joint injuries, and the cellular responses to injury were explored. The results demonstrate that even with limited data types, machine learning methods can effectively predict joint injury risk among basketball players, providing a valuable tool for injury prevention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Incredible progress has been made in human action recognition (HAR), significantly impacting computer vision applications in sports analytics. However, identifying dynamic and complex movements in sports like badminton remains challenging due to the need for precise recognition accuracy and better management of complex motion patterns. Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) improve recognition in large datasets, while the traditional machine learning methods like SVM (support vector machines), RF (random forest), and LR (logistic regression), combined with handcrafted features and ensemble approaches, perform well but struggle with the complexity of fast-paced sports like badminton. We proposed an ensemble learning model combining support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) for badminton action recognition. The data in this study consist of video recordings of badminton stroke techniques, which have been extracted into spatiotemporal data. The three-dimensional distance between each skeleton point and the right hip represents the spatial features. The temporal features are the results of Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FDTW) calculations applied to 15 frames of each video sequence. The weighted ensemble model employs soft voting classifiers from SVM, LR, RF, and AdaBoost to enhance the accuracy of badminton action recognition. The E2 ensemble model, which combines SVM, LR, and AdaBoost, achieves the highest accuracy of 95.38%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an original FL CNN framework specially designed for categorizing serve shots in table tennis. The approach deals with data security protection and stability challenges in the model. Standard pattern recognition methods typically require the collection of data to be centralized, which is quite problematic in terms of privacy and limits the number of available datasets. The FL method is applied as a collaborative approach to training models with distributed datasets where privacy is maintained while the set datasets are augmented to improve the resulting model. Comparison was also made of the FL CNN architecture with that of a conventional centralized structure. The FL model reached a classification accuracy of 92.5%, Precision of 93.2%, and Recall of 91. 8%, and the F1-score was equal to 92. 5%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the centralized model I achieved was 89. 70% for centrepiece agreement and a precision rate of 90. 5%, a recall rate of 88.Therefore, the percentage increases by 5%, and the median and metamorphotic increases by 19%. Specifically, it achieves an accuracy of 92%, Precision of 94%, Recall of 93% and F1-score of 89.3%. The study shows that the FL technique effectively controls many serve shots, and data privacy is well protected. The investigation of training loss revealed that the FL model had a lessened training loss compared to the centralized model over 20 epochs of training. The training losses in the FL model and the centralized model were 0 at the end, 22 and 18, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study presents an advanced approach to tackle prediction by considering comprehensive player and game data. This study proposes a hybrid modeling framework that integrates feature engineering with machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Classifiers and Neural Networks, to enhance the accuracy of tackle predictions. Our methodology begins with extensive preprocessing of the dataset, standardizing date formats, handling missing data, and transforming key variables such as player height and weight into more meaningful features like Body Mass Index (BMI). The integration of domain-specific features, including player age, position, and game-related statistics, allows for a more detailed understanding of the factors influencing tackle outcomes. Here, the models are trained and evaluated by using a rigorous train-test split and cross-validation approach, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving superior accuracy and predictive power. Through the use of confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analyses, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. This research highlights the potential of combining traditional machine learning methods with deep learning techniques to capture the complex dynamics of football.

This system can identify deviations from regular patterns, provide alerts, and ensure safety in case of emergencies or potential risks. These solutions enhance quality of life by promoting independent living while offering peace of mind to loved ones and caregivers. Visual impairments have become the chief part of these problems over the past few years. Usually, visually impaired people seek help from others to keep doing their daily tasks. An automated human activity recognition (HAR) technique could enhance a vision-impaired person's transaction activity and safe movement. HAR using deep learning (DL) includes training neural networks to automatically detect and classify various activities carried out by humans based on sensor information. By leveraging DL approaches, the HAR system could accurately identify and classify activities, including sitting, standing, walking, or running, from the information captured by sensors or wearable devices. This system is integral to smart home automation, healthcare, and sports analytics. This study develops an Automated Fractal Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm with Machine Learning based HAR (QSSA-MLHAR) for assisting elderly and visually impaired people. The QSSA-MLHAR technique uses sensory input data to identify human activities in diverse classes. In the QSSA-MLHAR technique, the min-max scalar is primarily used to scale the input data. Besides, the QSSA-MLHAR technique applies a mixed extreme learning machine (M-ELM) model to classify various human actions. The QSSA-based hyperparameter tuning process is used to improve the detection results of the M-ELM system. A wide range of simulations was performed to ensure the better performance of the QSSA-MLHAR method. The comprehensive outcomes assured that the QSSA-MLHAR technique performs well compared to other models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Among these sophisticated algorithms utilized by the model to achieve automatic classifications of cricket shots, human processes would invariably be significantly alleviated, giving noticeably better results when the model is used than by humans. Using a dataset of high-definition video clips obtained from professional cricket matches, the research is expected to achieve greater accuracy in the various shot types. The model structure used two CNNs to aggregate robust and reliable features from video frames. The extracted features are then used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM), which have been pledged to complete the classification task. Throughout the model's development process, it turned out to be very accurate, as test results proved it. The precision lies between 86.38% and 96.61%, while recall scores are between 88.65% to 97.98%. The F1 scores vary between 89.01% and 95.97%. The model got them commendably high accuracy, knowing there are some classes where no single class accuracy exceeded 98%. An intense observation of the confusion matrix offered an idea of the model's power in precisely identifying photographs with a high level of exactness and the ability to have confidence in this scenario. Besides that, it also reported places where miscopping was mainly caused by specific visual characteristics such as bird cancer disease, half-naked or smiling person. The data showed that using this model enhanced the decisions regarding making coaching plans and players' evaluations by timing shots. Hence, the panoramic model assists in building and applying CNN and SVM simultaneously for sports analytics and opens several avenues for the following research in automated sports performance monitoring in real-time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Advanced factories strongly need autonomous control methods of manufacturing robots flexibly responding to various requirements of the operational engineers. Deep reinforcement learning is more promising technology to support the dynamic factory situations than the legacy static robot control technologies are. The machine learning model experiences the computing resource limitation of industrial robots working the complex jobs of intelligent operations including machine vision, action planning and human collaborations. Policy distillation is a kind of model compression schemes of deep reinforcement learning by means of teacher-student model which make a pre-trained teacher model transfer its knowledge to structurally simplified student models in order to enhance the computing efficiency. However, it may have some problems of anomalous knowledge and abnormal robot movements in case the teacher model has a local optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a novel policy distillation with win probability added (WPA) based knowledge filtering algorithm for efficient industrial robot control. The proposed mechanism adopts the WPA method in sports analytics to evaluate the knowledge extracted from the teacher model and to filter bad knowledge out. The filtered knowledge is reconstructed with interpolation to train the student model with high-quality data. We perform the well-designed experiments, which show 11% compression enhancement and 5% reduction in execution time and steps required for the tasks, using a robot arm and a UGV as test environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this study, random forest algorithm was introduced into OpenPose network to improve model node occlusion, missed detection or false detection. In addition, to reduce the computational load of the network, the original OpenPose network was replaced by a lightweight OpenPose network. The experimental results show that the average processing time of the proposed model is about 90 ms, and the output video frame rate is 10 frames per second, which can meet the real-time requirements. This study analysed the students participating in the basketball league of the College of Sports Science of Nantong University, and the results confirmed the accuracy of the injury prediction of college basketball players based on FMS scores.

	abstract = {The approach categorized serve shot motions into five distinct classes, enabling detailed performance analysis for players and coaches to rely on the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) method to achieve the aim of our endeavor. This allowed us to aggregate local data learning into a unified global model. This study indicates that the data, which is international and the utility of which is further improved by the inputs of clients from different locations, has achieved significant levels of recall, precision, and accuracy, respectively. Client bj-5 achieved outstanding levels of precision and recall, with both metrics reaching 88.86% and 89.07%, respectively. The precision-recall score reached 0.89, while the accuracy was 0.96. In contrast, bj-2 exhibited a minor delay, achieving precision and recall rates of 76.96% and 77.21%, respectively. In that respect, the system got an F1-Score of 77.01% and an accuracy of 91%. Additional macro, micro, and weighted averages examination highlighted the model's reliable performance across different serve shot motions. The highest value of the macro average (i.e., 77.06%) was observed in model bj-2, while the lowest was recorded in model bj-5 (i.e., only 83.35%). Micro averages of the model showed a more comprehensive range of model accuracy, which was only 76.99% in the model bj-2, and only the model's robustness was confirmed by observing weighted averages ranging from 76.94% (bj-2) to 88.94% (bj-5). Results reveal the intervention as an opportunity for the branch of sports statistical analysis to create accurate predictive models while at the same time safeguarding athlete privacy. Our work not only enhances the set of methods used for analyzing athlete performance but also offers a scalable approach that may be used in other fields, including processing and analyzing sensitive data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thus, as a substitute method of determining severity in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), we explore the viability of combining electroencephalography (EEG) and artificial intelligence in this work.

Not least in terms of scouting, where resources, both human and financial, are very limited. There are tools that offer a catalogue of matches from multiple leagues, but the coverage of women's football is still very limited. Not only for match viewing, but it is also difficult to collect line-ups and substitutions from minor leagues. Viewing more than 2-3 leagues with continuity is complicated and on a data level there are still several steps to go before we can create metrics-based scouting processes, as we know in men's football. Within this context, we have created WTDTool, a tool capable of collecting basic information about players from around 30 leagues and the minutes played during the season. This information consists of data such as name, date of birth, position or height. In addition, important data in scouting processes is also collected, such as market value, contract expiry date or injuries that the players have had. Once all the information has been collected automatically, alert-generating processes are executed. This allows you to focus on a small number of players that meet specific criteria without having to carry out a search beforehand. We conducted an expert evaluation, all of them combining different roles within women's football, and they all agreed that WTDTool is an easy to use tool, useful in the scouting process, that helps to make the scouting process more efficient and that the alarms effectively put the spotlight on players likely to be scouted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Simultaneously, as Edge Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) gain traction, edge processing models bring computation closer to data origins, cutting down on latency and reliance on cloud services. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Streaming Machine Learning (SML) and Edge Computing in sports analytics, particularly in detecting passes during soccer matches. This research proposed several SML models trained directly on a microcontroller, using the Motus ml proprietary libraries TinySML and TinySML-P, aiming at distinguishing between passing and non-passing actions from data on leg movements collected from sensors embedded in players' footwear. We compare these algorithms to well-known SML libraries trained on a quad-core/16GB RAM machine hosted in the cloud, evaluating their classification performance and resource usage. Findings show that i) TinySML models executed in the cloud statistically outperform the state-of-The-Art ones, and ii) TinySML-P is the only one able to run on a microcontroller, achieving statistically similar results w.r.t. TinySML executed in the cloud. This establishes TinySML-P as a real-Time sports analytics solution within resource-constrained edge devices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Factors contributing to injury risk encompass a wide range of variables, including player physical characteristics, biomechanics, conditioning, fatigue, playing style, and history of previous injuries. Height, weight, wingspan, agility, sprint speed, and body fat percentage, which are the focus features of this study, can play pivotal roles in injury susceptibility.To address the multifaceted challenge of predicting injuries among NBA players based on various features, this project employs a range of machine learning models. Random Forest is utilized for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is applied for its instance-based learning that can classify players based on similar attributes, and Gradient Boosting is used to iteratively improve the model's predictions by focusing on the errors of previous iterations. These algorithms provide a robust framework for analyzing player data, enhancing the accuracy of injury predictions, and ultimately aiding in injury prevention and optimizing player performance. These models were evaluated using multiple metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy at 92.47%, followed by Gradient Boosting at 91.94%, and KNN at 88.17%.By analyzing historical injury data alongside these features, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay between player characteristics and injury risk and estimate injury probabilities. Through this approach, we provide valuable insight into injury prediction for NBA organizations, enhancing injury prevention and optimizing player performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Prolonged improper posture can lead to forward head posture (FHP), causing headaches, impaired respiratory function, and fatigue. This is especially relevant in sedentary scenarios, where individuals often maintain static postures for extended periods—a significant part of daily life for many. The development of a system capable of detecting FHP is crucial, as it would not only alert users to correct their posture but also serve the broader goal of contributing to public health by preventing the progression of chronic injuries associated with this condition. However, despite significant advancements in estimating human poses from standard 2D images, most computational pose models do not include measurements of the craniovertebral angle, which involves the C7 vertebra, crucial for diagnosing FHP. Objective: Accurate diagnosis of FHP typically requires dedicated devices, such as clinical postural assessments or specialized imaging equipment, but their use is impractical for continuous, real-time monitoring in everyday settings. Therefore, developing an accessible, efficient method for regular posture assessment that can be easily integrated into daily activities, providing real-time feedback, and promoting corrective action, is necessary. Methods: The system sequentially estimates 2D and 3D human anatomical key points from a provided 2D image, using the Detectron2D and VideoPose3D algorithms, respectively. It then uses a graph convolutional network (GCN), explicitly crafted to analyze the spatial configuration and alignment of the upper body’s anatomical key points in 3D space. This GCN aims to implicitly learn the intricate relationship between the estimated 3D key points and the correct posture, specifically to identify FHP. Results: The test accuracy was 78.27% when inputs included all joints corresponding to the upper body key points. The GCN model demonstrated slightly superior balanced performance across classes with an F<inf>1</inf>-score (macro) of 77.54%, compared to the baseline feedforward neural network (FFNN) model’s 75.88%. Specifically, the GCN model showed a more balanced precision and recall between the classes, suggesting its potential for better generalization in FHP detection across diverse postures. Meanwhile, the baseline FFNN model demonstrates a higher precision for FHP cases but at the cost of lower recall, indicating that while it is more accurate in confirming FHP when detected, it misses a significant number of actual FHP instances. This assertion is further substantiated by the examination of the latent feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, where the GCN model presented an isotropic distribution, unlike the FFNN model, which showed an anisotropic distribution. Conclusions: Based on 2D image input using 3D human pose estimation joint inputs, it was found that it is possible to learn FHP-related features using the proposed GCN-based network to develop a posture correction system. We conclude the paper by addressing the limitations of our current system and proposing potential avenues for future work in this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Active player tracking in sports analytics is crucial for understanding team dynamics, player performance, and game strategies. This paper introduces an innovative approach to tracking active players in handball videos using a fusion of the Multi-Deep SORT algorithm and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The novel integration aims to enhance player appearance for robust and precise tracking in dynamic gameplay. The system starts with a GAN model trained on annotated handball video data, generating synthetic frames to improve the visual quality and realism of player appearances, thereby refining the input data for tracking. The Multi-Deep SORT algorithm, enhanced with GAN-generated features, improves object association and continuous player tracking. This framework addresses key challenges in active player tracking, handling occlusions, variations in player appearances, and complex interactions. Additionally, GAN-based enhancements improve accuracy in distinguishing active from inactive players, facilitating precise localization and recognition. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's efficacy in achieving high tracking accuracy, robustness, and differentiation between player activity levels. Metrics such as Average Precision (AP), Average Recall (AR), accuracy, and F1-score affirm the system's advancement in active player tracking. This pioneering fusion of Multi-Deep SORT with GAN-based player appearance enhancement sets a new standard for precise, robust, and context-aware active player tracking in handball videos. It offers comprehensive insights for coaches, analysts, and players to optimize team strategies and performance. This paper highlights the novel integration's advancements and benefits in the domain of sports analytics.

The construction of a subjective prediction model for meniscus injury represents a potentially invaluable diagnostic tool for physicians. Nevertheless, given the variability of pathological manifestations among individual patients, machine learning-based models may produce errors when attempting to predict specific medical records. In order to mitigate this issue, the present study suggests the incorporation of metric learning within the machine learning (ML) modelling process, with the aim of reducing the intra-class spacing of comparable samples and thereby enhancing the classification accuracy of individual medical records.

Coaches rely on analytics to scout opponents and optimize play calls in gameplay. With the advancement in artificial intelligence, accessible and in-depth data collection has been enabled. The well-grounded technique for performance evaluation in sports analytics is Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Our focus is on real-time action recognition in combat sports like boxing. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are heavily parameterized, so can’t be used in real-time in any low-end devices. Apart from this, fine-grained classification in highly dynamic activities in sports are typically performed using sensors only. Our proposed Machine Learning based pipeline provides real-time fine-grained solution for 14 boxing punch types of classification using RGB video only. Our approach includes the implementation of three novel and generalized motion dynamics features that encode velocity as well as acceleration of the pose sequences., 1) Unified-Axis Angular Encoding (UAE), 2) 2D Motion Dynamics Descriptors (2DMDD), 3) Fifth-order Angular Encoding (FAE). We employed classical machine learning algorithms I.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to make a lightweight model and test it on YouTube videos. The average accuracies of pipeline using the proposed features are found to be 55%, 92% and 84% for UAE, 2DMDD, and FAE respectively. Using KNN, we have achieved 99% accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation by using FAE features. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The remarkable effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies has led to a significant increase in their application across various academic domains, particularly in diverse sports sectors. Over the past decade, scholars have utilized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in football for varied objectives, encompassing the analysis of football players' performances, injury prediction, market value forecasting, and action recognition. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of research addressing the evaluation of football players' performance, which is a noteworthy concern for coaches. Hence, the objective of this work is to categorize the performance of football players into active, normal, or weak based on activity features. This will be achieved through the utilization of the Performance Evaluation Machine Learning Model (PEMLM), employing two novel datasets that cover both training and match sessions. To attain this goal, seven machine learning methods are applied, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbor. The findings indicate that in the dataset corresponding to match sessions, the Decision Tree classifier attains the highest accuracy (100%) and the shortest test time. In contrast, the K-Nearest Neighbor demonstrates the best accuracy (96%) and a reasonable test time for the training dataset. These reported metrics underscore the reliability and validity of the proposed assessment approach in evaluating the performance of football players in online games. The results are verified and the models are assessed for overfitting through a k-fold cross-validation process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Yearly, the International Labor Organization report indicates many workplace accident occurrences. The degree of the happenings depends on the workplace environment setting and the incident regulatory measures implemented. By the nature of its work environment, the oil and gas upstream sector is susceptible to high incident rates. In the current fierce business competition and practices, improving productivity, quality, and other processes, such as Safety, is vital. Implementing well-designed safety procedures is the key to managing and reducing the risk level of workplace incidents. Methods: Recently, the application of Machine learning (ML) modeling for accident/injury prediction has been reported in the construction, mining, transport, and health sectors. Likewise, the objective of this paper was to implement three machine-learning-based models to predict injury rates in a drilling operation. The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway provided the datasets. First, the dataset was pre-processed, and then the selected features and target dataset were used for the modeling. Finally, the model prediction and performance accuracy analysis were performed. Results: Results showed that multivariable regression (MVR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms-based models predict the test data with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9576, 0.793, and 0.97036, respectively. Conclusion: As the common saying goes, 'prevention is better than cure.' For this, implementing methods such as improved work processes and Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) mitigation procedures, workplace injuries, and accidents allow for reducing the risk level of workplace injuries. The application of integrated machine learning tools, along with carefully built-in workplace accident database implementation, will provide early detection and possible remedial precautions that can be taken to prevent workplace injuries/accidents/fatalities. However, extensive research and development are required to deploy the method in real life. Combining Machine Learning modeling and carefully designed safety measures is vital for successful and robust predictive tools. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Results: In the experimental phase, skeletal motion datasets from various cohorts, including professional athletes and fitness enthusiasts, are utilized for validation. Comparative analysis against traditional methods demonstrates significant enhancements in specificity, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Notably, specificity increases by ~5%, accuracy reaches around 90%, recall improves to around 91%, and the F1-score exceeds 89%. Discussion: The proposed skeletal motion analysis method, leveraging Transformer and Graph Neural Networks, proves successful in optimizing exercise training and preventing injuries. By effectively amalgamating global and local information and integrating Generative Adversarial Networks, the method excels in capturing motion features and enhancing precision and adaptability. Future research endeavors will focus on further advancing this methodology to provide more robust technological support for healthy exercise practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, there is currently no effective therapy for AKI in sepsis. Therefore, the therapeutic approach is focused on prevention. Based on this, there is an opportunity to examine a panel of biomarker models for predicting AKI. Material and Methods: This prospective cohort study analysed the differences in Cystatin C, Beta-2 Microglobulin, and NGAL levels in sepsis patients with AKI and sepsis patients without AKI. The biomarker modelling of AKI prediction was done using machine learning, namely Orange Data Mining. In this study, 130 samples were analysed by machine learning. The parameters used to obtain the biomarker panel were 23 laboratory examination parameters. Results: This study used SVM and the Naïve Bayes model of machine learning. The SVM model’s sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 50%, 94.4%, 71.4%, and 87.5%, respectively. For the Naïve Bayes model, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 83.3%, 77.8%, 87.5%, and 71.4%, respectively. Discussion: This study’s SVM machine learning model has higher AUC and specificity but lower sensitivity. The Naïve Bayes model had better sensitivity; it can be used to predict AKI in sepsis patients. Conclusion: The Naïve Bayes machine learning model in this study is useful for predicting AKI in sepsis patients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The emergence of data-driven analytics and intelligent monitoring systems is radically transforming the world of competitive sports. However, robust real-time activity recognition remains elusive for rapid-paced sports like table tennis due to the complexity of strokes and quick maneuvering. This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization. Our proposed model outperformed the latest models in this field with higher accuracy, recall values, F1-score, and precision. While expanding the dataset diversity and testing variations of deep network architectures could further enhance performance, this paper demonstrates a crucial leap toward helping real-time analytics in table tennis using an AI-powered computer vision approach. The hybrid system combining IoT, wearables, and machine learning establishes a framework to transform data into actionable and timely insights for table tennis players and coaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

AI brings game-changing approaches for soccer analytics where soccer has been a typical benchmark for AI research. The combination has been an emerging topic. In this paper, soccer match analytics are taken as a complete observation-orientation-decision-action (OODA) loop. In addition, as in AI frameworks such as that for reinforcement learning, interacting with a virtual environment enables an evolving model. Therefore, both soccer analytics in the real world and virtual domains are discussed. With the intersection of the OODA loop and the real-virtual domains, available soccer data, including event and tracking data, and diverse orientation and decision-making models for both real-world and virtual soccer matches are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, some promising directions in this interdisciplinary area are pointed out. It is claimed that paradigms for both professional sports analytics and AI research could be combined. Moreover, it is quite promising to bridge the gap between the real and virtual domains for soccer match analysis and decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our methodology involved data collection, engineering, and mining; the application of techniques such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), isolation forest, and the Z score for anomaly detection; and the application of the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining. Anomaly detection revealed 189 anomalies (1.04% of cases), highlighting unusual recovery durations and factors influencing recovery beyond physical healing. Association rule mining indicated shorter recovery times for lower extremity injuries and a 95% confidence level for quick returns from “Rest” injuries, affirming the NBA’s treatment and rest policies. Additionally, economic factors were observed, with players in lower salary brackets experiencing shorter recoveries, pointing to a financial influence on recovery decisions. This study offers critical insights into sports injuries and recovery, providing valuable information for sports professionals and league administrators.

	abstract = {Hospital-acquired pressure injury is one of the most harmful events in clinical settings. Patients who do not receive early prevention and treatment can experience a significant financial burden and physical trauma. Several hospital-acquired pressure injury prediction algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, but these models assume a consensus, gold-standard label (i.e., presence of pressure injury or not) is present for all training data. Existing definitions for identifying hospital-acquired pressure injuries are inconsistent due to the lack of high-quality documentation surrounding pressure injuries. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an ensemble-based algorithm that leverages truth inference methods to resolve label inconsistencies between various case definitions and the level of disagreements in annotations. Application of our method to MIMIC-III, a publicly available intensive care unit dataset, gives empirical results that illustrate the promise of learning a prediction model using truth inference-based labels and observed conflict among annotators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A recent study applied Random Forest algorithm to identify important variables to classify rugby league players into academy and senior levels and achieved 82.0% and 67.5% accuracy for backs and forwards. However, the classification accuracy could be improved due to limitations in the existing method. Therefore, this study aimed to introduce and implement feature selection technique to identify key performance indicators in rugby league positional groups and assess the performances of six classification algorithms. Fifteen and fourteen of 157 performance indicators for backs and forwards were identified respectively as key performance indicators by the correlation-based feature selection method, with seven common indicators between the positional groups. Classification results show that models developed using the key performance indicators had improved performance for both positional groups than models developed using all performance indicators. 5-Nearest Neighbour produced the best classification accuracy for backs and forwards (accuracy = 85% and 77%) which is higher than the previous method’s accuracies. When analysing classification questions in sport science, researchers are encouraged to evaluate multiple classification algorithms and a feature selection method should be considered for identifying key variables. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Consequently, being a multi-format and multi-variable game, cricket raises a lot of challenges in respect to making a perfect prediction of the match. The paper proposes a new deep learning-based prediction approach for One Day International (ODI) cricket, using Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with an attention mechanism. While traditional machine learning-based models have shown some promise, they still suffer from the inability to capture long-term dependencies within a cricket match sequential data. The LSTM architecture inherently tends to learn these temporal patterns really well; hence, it is particularly suited for this task. The attention mechanism further enhances this model, where the critical moments in the match are solely responsible for the outcome. Based on this, detection will be done with an extensive dataset covering more than matches of various cricket formats: ODI, T20I, and Test matches. The dataset is a collection from ESPNcricinfo and other official cricket databases, including ball-by-ball information with relevant contextual features: performance metrics from teams, player statistics, weather conditions, and venue information. With this great performance, it was much higher than the best performance of traditional machine learning approaches by as high as 94%. This work provides new insights into applying deep learning to sports analytics and opens up more possibilities toward innovation in predicting the results of cricket matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There has been a noticeable upsurge in the amount of research conducted in the last several years on the analysis of human behavior, especially among computer vision experts. Technological developments and the growing uses of human activity recognition (HAR) in various industries, including healthcare, sports analytics, and human-computer interface, are responsible for the growing interest. Deep learning techniques are the most promising of the different approaches to HAR because of their capacity to extract intricate patterns from enormous datasets. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing human activities utilizing 3D skeleton information. A wide range of human movements can be accurately recognized and categorized using this method, which makes use of deep learning's capabilities. The center parts of our approach are illustrated as Joint Position Scaling and Temporal Alignment. After normalization, the 3D skeleton data is represented in two different forms like Spatial Representation and Temporal Representation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been employed on the features extracted from the deep neural network to improve our model's classification accuracy. The output from the second last layer of the neural network is used to train the SVM, allowing it to draw a decision boundary that effectively divides movements of gait. Bayesian Optimization technique has been used to adjust each hyperparameter to make sure our model was resilient. This approach is very useful as it finds the best configurations by quickly exploring the hyperparameter space. The PKU-MMD dataset, which offered a thorough baseline for our model's training, was used for the optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

From player performance evaluation to strategic decision-making, AI technologies have revolutionized how cricket is understood and played. In this paper, we focus on the task of classifying cricket shots using video data, leveraging deep learning methodologies. The proposed model aims to classify cricket videos into five distinct shot categories, utilizing the CricShot10 dataset originally comprising ten shot classes. With approximately 100-150 video clips per shot type, we streamline the classification task by selecting five fundamental shots for analysis.

To better accommodate the increasingly shortened vehicle development cycles, this paper thoroughly explores the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting head injury in pedestrian protection. Based on 25 different vehicle models, key features at impact points were defined according to finite element simulation models and results, and a head injury database was constructed. Various machine learning algorithms were then used in a comparative study to identify the optimal predictive model. In tests with three randomly selected new vehicle models, the R<sup>2</sup> values were approximately 0.7, with a maximum of 0.7456, and prediction times were within seconds, greatly enhancing prediction efficiency.

	abstract = {This study used a novel machine learning approach to uncover key serve variables that maximize effectiveness in men’s professional doubles tennis. A large dataset of 14,146 serves from 97 Davis Cup doubles matches played between 2010 and 2019 was analyzed using explainable AI techniques. The angle and distance from the bounce to the sidelines of the serves were found to best distinguish the points won with aces from rallies lasting more than three strokes. Optimal serve angle ranges of 5.7–8.7° substantially increased the probability of serving an ace by over 80%, compared to around 30% when serving used more central angles. Lateral bounce distances of 0–28 cm from the sidelines also boosted the ace probability by over 50%. The serve speed was shown to have less influence on serve effectiveness as compared to singles tennis, with velocities above 187 km h<sup>−1</sup> only increasing the probability of serving an ace by 10%. These findings have important practical implications for the tactical decision-making and technical training of serves in men’s professional doubles tennis. The data highlight that the angle and placement of serves are more important than velocity for attaining effective serves in doubles. Coaches and players can use this knowledge to pay special attention to the most important variables in the effectiveness of serves, such as the line distance and angle, in order to maximize the performance of the doubles serve. The novel methodology used in this study provides a valid and reliable way to calculate the efficiency of actions in various sport disciplines using tracking data and machine learning approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: To compare a three-dimensional (3D) artificial intelligence (AI)- driven model with panoramic radiography (PANO) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in assessing the risk of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury after mandibular wisdom tooth (M3M) removal through a within-patient controlled trial. Methods: From a database of 6,010 patients undergoing M3M surgery, 25 patients met the inclusion criteria of bilateral M3M removal with postoperative unilateral IAN injury. In this within-patient controlled trial, preoperative PANO and CBCT images were available, while 3D-AI models of the mandibular canal and teeth were generated from the CBCT images using the Virtual Patient Creator AI platform (Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium). Five examiners, who were blinded to surgical outcomes, assessed the imaging modalities and assigned scores indicating the risk level of IAN injury (high, medium, or low risk). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) for IAN risk assessment were calculated for each imaging modality. Results: For IAN injury risk assessment after M3M removal, sensitivity was 0.87 for 3D-AI, 0.89 for CBCT versus 0.73 for PANO. Furthermore, the AUC and specificity values were 0.63 and 0.39 for 3D-AI, 0.58 and 0.28 for CBCT, and 0.57 and 0.41 for PANO, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the imaging modalities for any diagnostic parameters. Conclusion: This within-patient controlled trial study revealed that risk assessment for IAN injury after M3M removal was rather similar for 3D-AI, PANO, and CBCT, with a sensitivity for injury prediction reaching up to 0.87 for 3D-AI and 0.89 for CBCT. Clinical significance: This within-patient trial is pioneering in exploring the application of 3D AI-driven models for assessing IAN injury risk after M3M removal. The present results indicate that AI-powered 3D models based on CBCT might facilitate IAN risk assessment of M3M removal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in 2020, the global community has faced ongoing challenges in controlling and mitigating the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as its evolving subvariants and recombinants. A significant challenge during the pandemic has not only been the accurate detection of positive cases but also the efficient prediction of risks associated with complications and patient survival probabilities. These tasks entail considerable clinical resource allocation and attention. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net Biochem, a versatile and explainable framework for constructing machine learning models. We apply this framework to predict COVID-19 patient survival and the likelihood of developing Acute Kidney Injury during hospitalization, utilizing clinical and biochemical data in a transparent, systematic approach. The proposed approach advances machine learning model design by seamlessly integrating domain expertise with explainability tools, enabling model decisions to be based on key biomarkers. This fosters a more transparent and interpretable decision-making process made by machines specifically for medical applications. More specifically, the framework comprises two phases: In the first phase, referred to as the “clinician-guided design” phase, the dataset is preprocessed using explainable AI and domain expert input. To better demonstrate this phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully curated clinical and biochemical markers based on clinician assessments for survival and kidney injury prediction in COVID-19 patients. This dataset was selected from a patient cohort of 1366 individuals at Stony Brook University. Moreover, we designed and trained a diverse collection of machine learning models, encompassing gradient-based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures, specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the selected markers. In the second phase, called the “explainability-driven design refinement” phase, the proposed framework employs explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding of each model’s decision-making process but also to identify the overall impact of individual clinical and biochemical markers for bias identification. In this context, we used the models constructed in the previous phase for the prediction task and analyzed the explainability outcomes alongside a clinician with over 8 years of experience to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical validity of the decisions made. The explainability-driven insights obtained, in conjunction with the associated clinical feedback, are then utilized to guide and refine the training policies and architectural design iteratively. This process aims to enhance not only the prediction performance but also the clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Employing the proposed explainability-driven framework, we attained 93.55% accuracy in survival prediction and 88.05% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complications. The models have been made available through an open-source platform. Although not a production-ready solution, this study aims to serve as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, and citizen scientists to develop innovative and trustworthy clinical decision support solutions, ultimately assisting clinicians worldwide in managing pandemic outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to improving basketball players’ shooting skills rely on coaches’ experience in adjusting players’ biomechanical motions. However, such an approach cannot provide specific instructions or facilitate immediate feedback for improvement of the shooting motion. In this article, a method is presented to quantitatively evaluate four key action indicators of shooting basketballs using a machine-learning model based on Bayesian optimization of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). Important motion data for the model are collected by micro-inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment. The LightGBM model is then developed for the regression prediction of the four action indicators of shooting. In the results, it is indicated that for an individual player, the highest correlation scores of the four indexes range from 97.6% to 99.3%. The proposed approach for quantitatively assessing shooting indexes can provide objective and data-based guidance to improve players’ shooting performance. Foreseeably, the prediction model can be embedded into a chip of a wearable device to evaluate the real-time shot quality quantitatively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study provides an in-game prediction of the winner for Twenty20 (T20) cricket by focusing on the matches played in the Indian Premier League. For the analysis, data were collected from 812 completed matches played between 2008 and 2020. Initially, several candidate features were identified, and then the LASSO method was applied as a feature selection technique to identify the most important set of features. Based on the identified important features, predictions are provided for each stage of a match where a T20 match can consist of a maximum of 240 stages. For each stage, three classification models were formed using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. The prediction accuracy was used for evaluating the findings of the study, and the prediction accuracy of each model indicates the ratio between the number of correctly predicted instances and the total number of predicted instances. Naive Bayes demonstrated prediction accuracies ranging from 53.08% to 91.76% between the first and the 240th stage of matches, whereas the accuracy of Logistic Regression varied from 56.92% to 97.65%. In comparison, Support Vector Machines also displayed comparable outcomes with a prediction accuracy of 55.00% at the first stage, and 90.59% at the 240th stage. Furthermore, a strategy generator that assists the competing teams in the second innings to devise winning strategies, is presented in this study alongside an interactive web-based application for making in-game predictions, and for assisting the end users (players and coaching/managing staff) in decision making, based on the generated winning strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The sports domain contains significant computational impediments to artificial intelligence and analysis capability. In this study, I investigate performance analysis methodologies that have been applied to team sports challenges thus far. Sports and injury prediction, player investment, match outcome prediction, and limits are among our specialties. By evaluating research in these disciplines, we study how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to anticipate matches and assist sports teams in making better tactical and strategic decisions. These minor details might sometimes escape human notice. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders, who developed a computer algorithm recently that can assess any discomfort associated with sports. These little things can occasionally elude human vision. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders. This work is based on an exploratory investigation of AI applications in team games. The project's purpose is to look at the existing and potential applications of AI in team sports performance monitoring. The study also looked at the constraints of employing AI. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) enters the picture. However, the scope of AI is still uncertain. The game's stakeholders must also be aware of AI's limits. Overall, this study revealed that using AI and other technologies to improve team competitiveness, decision-making, and customer experience can help teams achieve goals and open up new options. According to this study, team sports such as basketball and football have profited immensely from artificial intelligence (AI), but AI's full potential has yet to be achieved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant cause of drug failure and withdrawal due to liver damage. Accurate prediction of hepatotoxic compounds is crucial for safe drug development. Several DILI prediction models have been published, but they are built on different data sets, making it difficult to compare model performance. Moreover, most existing models are based on molecular fingerprints or descriptors, neglecting molecular geometric properties and lacking interpretability. To address these limitations, we developed GeoDILI, an interpretable graph neural network that uses a molecular geometric representation. First, we utilized a geometry-based pretrained molecular representation and optimized it on the DILI data set to improve predictive performance. Second, we leveraged gradient information to obtain high-precision atomic-level weights and deduce the dominant substructure. We benchmarked GeoDILI against recently published DILI prediction models, as well as popular GNN models and fingerprint-based machine learning models using the same data set, showing superior predictive performance of our proposed model. We applied the interpretable method in the DILI data set and derived seven precise and mechanistically elucidated structural alerts. Overall, GeoDILI provides a promising approach for accurate and interpretable DILI prediction with potential applications in drug discovery and safety assessment.

Markers of kidney damage: kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may ease early diagnosis of AKI. The aim of this study was to assess serum concentrations of KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL in children undergoing HSCT in relation to classical markers of kidney function (creatinine, cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and to analyze their usefulness as predictors of kidney damage with the use of artificial intelligence tools. Serum concentrations of KIM-1, IL-18, NGAL, and cystatin C were assessed by ELISA in 27 children undergoing HSCT before transplantation and up to 4 weeks after the procedure. The data was used to build a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model of renal injury prediction. The RFC model established on the basis of 3 input variables, KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL concentrations in the serum of children before HSCT, was able to effectively assess the rate of patients with hyperfiltration, a surrogate marker of kidney injury 4 weeks after the procedure. With the use of the RFC model, serum KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL may serve as markers of incipient renal dysfunction in children after HSCT. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {These days, improving students’ learning and work efficiency needs a comprehensive approach to their physical and mental well-being, which emphasizes the critical role of teachers and institutions. To optimize the responsibilities of physical teachers and coaches, efficient administration of physical education, including sports activities, and a strong quality assurance system are required. Based on the above, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sports management system to enhance work efficiency and ease of physical education teachers and coaches. It aims to make an in-depth study on the construction of sports performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining; later, it includes the construction of sports management systems. This paper operates in such a way that it first discusses the sports performance management and physical analysis system's construction. Second, it analyses the overall framework structure of the system by presenting a detailed description of the sports test management and test items management. In addition, it analyses sports performance management and sports performance, system management and physical performance and other functional modules contained in the system along with the database design in the system based on C4.5 that is then used as the Decision Tree (DT) Classifier for data mining. Third, it uses sports performance management of DT, and the physical analysis algorithm uses the data information gained to select the split attributes. Fourth, it divides the sports performance training data set into multiple sub-datasets to construct the performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining. Finally, the suggested system is compared with existing approaches and obtains an accuracy of 97%, which is 27% high than the selected approaches. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has high accuracy in data mining related to sports performance and can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of physical education teachers. The proposed system will be an addition to intelligent task management with high feasibility and accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The identification of postoperative ARDS subtypes may optimize individualized clinical management. Objectives: To identify the subtypes of postoperative ARDS and explore the impact of therapy on outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study used data obtained from a database. Patients diagnosed with ARDS who underwent surgical procedures within 7 days were included in the study. Laboratory and clinical variables were used for latent profile analysis (LPA). XGBoost and multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the association between therapy and outcomes. Results: A total of 1065 patients were included. The LPA identified three subtypes of postoperative ARDS: Patients in profile 1 were mainly accepted neurosurgery, while those in profile 2 and 3 were treated with orthopedic and vascular or thoracic surgery, respectively. The XGBoost model effectively predicted mortality with an AUC of 0.935, which was higher than SOFA (0.622), APACHE 2 (0.629), SLIP (0.579), and SLIP-2 (0.550).

	abstract = {Creating decision models for risk assessment of ski injuries is a challenging task. Ski injuries are rare events, but they carry a high cost, that is, can cause working or movement disabilities. Usually, ski risk assessment is performed on small-scale, case-controlled studies where the effect of a single factor is evaluated. Recently, data mining and machine learning algorithms are being employed for ski risk assessment and injury prediction. However, these models do not generally satisfy the need for interpretation of the decision model, do not provide explanations for the predictions, and in general do not ensure the completeness and consistency of decision rules. To make data mining and machine learning models useful, one needs to implement the aforementioned properties. Decision support systems are expected to have these properties; however, the process of building such decision support systems is still tedious: it has to consider human biases, assumptions, and subjective values, as well as focus on the decision problem being solved. We propose a method for extraction of decision models from data at hand. Our method DIDEX, Data Induced DEcision eXpert, builds models that have desirable properties for inclusion in decision support systems. The proposed method is used to build a decision model for ski injury prediction based on data from Mt. Kopaonik ski resort, Serbia. The results show that DIDEX generates up to a five times simpler model compared to the existing domain expert DEX models while having a 6% better predictive accuracy. Additionally, its predictive accuracy is comparable to similar machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree classifiers, random forest, and logistic regression. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the sports industry has witnessed a significant rise in interest in leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance players' performance. However, the application of deep learning to improve badminton athletes' performance faces challenges related to identifying weaknesses, generating winning suggestions, and validating strategy effectiveness. These challenges arise due to the limited availability of realistic environments and agents. This paper aims to address these research gaps and make contributions to the badminton community. To achieve this goal, we propose a closed-loop approach consisting of six key components: Badminton Data Acquisition, Imitating Players' Styles, Simulating Matches, Optimizing Strategies, Training Execution, and Real-World Competitions. Specifically, we developed a novel model called RallyNet, which excels at imitating players' styles, allowing agents to accurately replicate real players' behavior. Secondly, we created a sophisticated badminton simulation environment that incorporates real-world physics, faithfully recreating game situations. Thirdly, we employed reinforcement learning techniques to improve players' strategies, enhancing their chances of winning while preserving their unique playing styles. By comparing strategy differences before and after improvement, we provide winning suggestions to players, which can be validated against diverse opponents within our carefully designed environment. Lastly, through collaborations with badminton venues and players, we apply the generated suggestions to the players' training and competitions, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we continuously gather data from training and competitions, incorporating it into the closed-loop cycle to refine strategies and suggestions. This research presents an innovative approach for continuously improving players' performance, contributing to the field of AI-driven sports performance enhancement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Falls in older adults are potentially devastating, whereas an accurate fall risk prediction model for community-dwelling older Chinese is still lacking. The objective of this study was to build prediction models for falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling older adults in China. Methods: This study used data (Waves 2015 and 2018) from 5,818 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A total of 107 input variables at the baseline level were regarded as candidate features. Five machine learning algorithms were used to build the 3-year fall and fall-related injury risk prediction models. SHapley Additive exPlanations was used for the prediction model explanation. Analyses were conducted in 2022. Results: The logistic regression model achieved the best performance among fall and fall-related injury prediction models with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.739 and 0.757, respectively. Experience of falling was the most important feature in both models. Other important features included basic activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, depressive symptoms, house tidiness, grip strength, and sleep duration. The important features unique to the fall model were house temperature, sex, and flush toilets, whereas lung function, smoking, and Internet access were exclusively related to the fall-related injury model. Conclusions: This study suggests that the optimal models hold promise for screening out older adults at high risk for falls in facilitated targeted interventions. Fall prevention strategies should specifically focus on fall history, physical functions, psychological factors, and home environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The search for monitoring tools that provide early indication of injury and illness could contribute to better player protection. The aim of the present study was to i) determine the feasibility of and adherence to our monitoring approach, and ii) identify variables associated with up-coming illness and injury. We incorporated a comprehensive set of monitoring tools consisting of external load and physical fitness data, questionnaires, blood, neuromuscular-, hamstring, hip abductor and hip adductor performance tests performed over a three-month period in elite under-18 academy soccer players. Twenty-five players (age: 16.6 ± 0.9 years, height: 178 ± 7 cm, weight: 74 ± 7 kg, VO<inf>2max</inf>: 59 ± 4 ml/min/kg) took part in the study. In addition to evaluating adherence to the monitoring approach, data were analyzed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict illness and injuries. The approach was feasible, with no injuries or dropouts due to the monitoring pro-cess. Questionnaire adherence was high at the beginning and de-creased steadily towards the end of the study. An SVM resulted in the best classification results for three classification tasks, i.e., illness prediction, illness determination and injury prediction. For injury prediction, one of four injuries present in the test data set was detected, with 96.3% of all data points (i.e., injuries and non-injuries) correctly detected. For both illness prediction and deter-mination, there was only one illness in the test data set that was detected by the linear SVM. However, the model showed low pre-cision for injury and illness prediction with a considerable num-ber of false-positives. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a holistic monitoring approach with the possibility of predicting illness and injury. Additional data points are needed to improve the prediction models. In practical application, this may lead to over-cautious recommendations on when players should be protected from injury and illness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite these models being mainly developed using datasets generated from drug-like molecules, they were also applied to the prediction of hepatotoxicity caused by herbal products. As deep learning has achieved great success in many different fields, advanced machine learning algorithms have been actively applied to improve the accuracy of in silico models. Additionally, the development of liver AOPs, combined with big data in toxicology, has been valuable in developing in silico models with enhanced predictive performance and interpretability. Specifically, one approach involves developing structure-based models for predicting molecular initiating events of liver AOPs, while others use in vitro data with structure information as model inputs for making predictions. Even though liver injury remains a difficult endpoint to predict, advancements in machine learning algorithms and the expansion of in vitro databases with relevant biological knowledge have made a huge impact on improving in silico modeling for drug-induced liver injury prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics have benefited immensely from the growth and popularity of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These techniques enable sports analysts to evaluate player performance more effectively. A literature review of player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A novel framework was proposed to evaluate batsman strength based on individual performance, role in the team, and team interactions. Traditionally, proposed ranking systems are derived from static networks, that is, the aggregation of game results over time. However, the scores of the players (or teams) fluctuate over time. Intuitively, defeating a renowned player during peak performance is more rewarding than defeating the same player during other periods. To account for this, we propose a new method and apply it to the T20 format Indian Premier League. The method serves three main purposes: First, it creates a new performance index for players to rank them more accurately and effectively. Second, the players are clustered based on their expertise. In the third phase, a social network analysis approach is applied to visualize and analyze crickets as a network to gain better insights into players’ team interactions. This novel approach is a helpful index for sports coaches, analysts, cricket fans, and managers to evaluate player performance and rank for future aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with trauma and is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, early prediction of AKI in patients with trauma is important for risk stratification and the provision of optimal intensive care unit treatment. This study aimed to compare 2 models, machine learning (ML) techniques and logistic regression, in predicting AKI in patients with trauma. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 400 patients who sustained torso injuries between January 2016 and June 2020. Patients were included if they were aged > 15 years, admitted to the intensive care unit, survived for > 48 hours, had thoracic and/or abdominal injuries, had no end-stage renal disease, and had no missing data. AKI was defined in accordance with the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition and staging system. The patients were divided into 2 groups: AKI (n = 78) and non-AKI (n = 322). We divided the original dataset into a training (80%) and a test set (20%), and the logistic regression with stepwise selection and ML (decision tree with hyperparameter optimization using grid search and cross-validation) was used to build a model for predicting AKI. The models established using the training dataset were evaluated using a confusion matrix receiver operating characteristic curve with the test dataset. We included 400 patients with torso injury, of whom 78 (19.5%) progressed to AKI. Age, intestinal injury, cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours, and the use of vasopressors were independent risk factors for AKI in the logistic regression model. In the ML model, vasopressors were the most important feature, followed by cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours and packed red blood cell transfusion within 4 hours. The accuracy score showed no differences between the 2 groups; however, the recall and F1 score were significantly higher in the ML model (.94 vs 56 and.75 vs 64, respectively). The ML model performed better than the logistic regression model in predicting AKI in patients with trauma. ML techniques can aid in risk stratification and the provision of optimal care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As artificial intelligence spreads out to numerous fields, the application of AI to sports analytics is also in the spotlight. However, one of the major challenges is the difficulty of automated acquisition of continuous movement data during sports matches. In particular, it is a conundrum to reliably track a tiny ball on a wide soccer pitch with obstacles such as occlusion and imitations. Tackling the problem, this paper proposes an inference framework of ball trajectory from player trajectories as a cost-efficient alternative to ball tracking. We combine Set Transformers to get permutation-invariant and equivariant representations of the multi-agent contexts with a hierarchical architecture that intermediately predicts the player ball possession to support the final trajectory inference. Also, we introduce the reality loss term and postprocessing to secure the estimated trajectories to be physically realistic. The experimental results show that our model provides natural and accurate trajectories as well as admissible player ball possession at the same time. Lastly, we suggest several practical applications of our framework including missing trajectory imputation, semi-automated pass annotation, automated zoom-in for match broadcasting, and calculating possession-wise running performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Creativity is highly valued in soccer players. It contributes to exciting and unpredictable play, which can help teams to overcome defensive strategies and create scoring opportunities. Consequently, evaluating the creative abilities of players is an important aspect of the player recruitment process. However, there is currently no clear way to measure creativity in soccer. It is not captured by the typical result-based performance indicators, as being creative entails going beyond just doing something useful, to accomplishing something useful but in a unique or atypical way. Therefore in this paper, we define a novel metric to quantify the level of creativity involved in a player's passes. Our Creative Decision Rating (CDR) utilizes machine learning techniques to assess two important factors: the originality of a pass, and its value in terms of increasing the team's chances of scoring a goal. We validated our metric on StatsBomb 360 contextual event stream data of the 2021/22 English Premier League season and show through a number of use cases that it provides another angle on a player's skill, complementing existing player evaluation metrics. Overall, our metric provides a concise method for capturing and quantifying the creativity of soccer players and could have important implications for player recruitment and talent development in the sport. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the recent progress in sports analytics, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of mining insights into players' tactics for improving performance quality and fan engagement. This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and women's singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players' tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The aim of this systematic review was to identify ETs used in field-based sport to monitor TL for injury/performance prediction and provide sport specific recommendations by identifying new data generation in which coaches may consider when tracking players for an increased accuracy in training prescription and evaluation among field-based sports. Data was extracted from 60 articles following a systematic search of CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and IEEE XPLORE databases. Global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometers were common external TL tools and Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) for internal TL. A collection of analytics tools were identified when investigating injury/performance prediction. Machine Learning showed promising results in many studies, identifying the strongest predictive variables and injury risk identification. Overall, a variety of TL monitoring tools and predictive analytics were utilized by researchers and were successful in predicting injury/performance, but no common method taken by researchers could be identified. This review highlights the positive effect of ETs, but further investigation is desired towards a 'gold standard"predictive analytics tool for injury/performance prediction in field-based team sports. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As this problem has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing work on representing strategic relations among players’ shot types and movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion for Movement Forecasting model (DyMF) with interaction style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and between both players within a rally, and dynamic players’ tactics across time. In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods and demonstrate the practical usage of movement forecasting.

Method: During the 2022 European Championships in Munich (Germany), all registered athletes, coaches, and health professionals were asked to complete an online questionnaire on their perception and beliefs of injury prediction use as an injury risk reduction measure. The agreement on the interest, intent to use, perceived help and potential stress, were assessed using an analogic scale from 0 (i.e. not at all) to 100 (i.e. totally). Results: We collected a total of 79 responses: 35 athletes, 14 coaches, and 29 health professionals, from 23 countries. They all expressed a high level of agreement regarding the interest (86 ± 15), intent to use (84 ± 16), and perceived help (85 ± 16) of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure. Regarding potential stress induced by injury prediction, the level of agreement was moderate (41 ± 33), and there was an important inter-individual variability in each stakeholder group (athletes, coaches, health professionals). Conclusions: This was the first study investigating the perception and beliefs of elite athletics athletes, coaches, and health professionals regarding the use of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure. Regardless of the stakeholders, there was a high level of acceptance reported in this potential measure. These findings have important implications for future research and in practice in the use of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure in elite athletics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this article, we implemented machine learning algorithms for injury risk estimation in 284 male footballers playing in 16 professional or semi-professional football teams from 3 countries. The predictors (input data) of the algorithms consisted of an athlete's baseline dataset, including hamstring injury history in the previous season and data measured during a maximum sprint of 30 m. The output data, binary, was the occurrence of hamstring injury. The three models used, logistic regression, random forests and AdaBoost, were compared to a dummy classifier. The results showed that it is possible, to a certain extent, to predict the occurrence of injury with these models. The comparison with the dummy classifier, when considering a set of metrics including F1-score, showed the interest of the three models used. Additionally, the relative importance of predictors can be measured, which can aid in understanding the predominant factors influencing injury.

	abstract = {Purpose: To (1) identify neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk factors in elite youth soccer players and (2) assess the predictive ability of a machine learning approach. Material and Methods: Fifty-six elite male youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years; height: 179 ± 8 cm; mass: 70.4 ± 9.2 kg) performed a 3D motion analysis, postural control testing, and strength testing. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to identify the most important injury predictors. Predictive performance of the LASSO model was determined in a leave-one-out (LOO) prediction competition. Results: Twenty-three non-contact injuries were registered. The LASSO model identified concentric knee extensor peak torque, hip transversal plane moment in the single-leg drop landing task and center of pressure sway in the single-leg stance test as the three most important predictors for injury in that order. The LASSO model was able to predict injury outcomes with a likelihood of 58% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.63 (sensitivity = 35%; specificity = 79%). Conclusion: The three most important variables for predicting the injury outcome suggest the importance of neuromuscular and biomechanical performance measures in elite youth soccer. These preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and planning, as well as for the development of customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors. However, the poor predictive performance of the final model confirms the challenge of predicting sports injuries, and the model must therefore be evaluated in larger samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The popularity of analytical research specializing in forecasting of March Madness saw an increase in the past decades. While the influence of nongame statistics on the game outcome has become a great interest in sports analytics, little research has focused on situational factors in predicting sports tournament outcomes. Therefore, this study is to examine the use of different machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and random forest (RF), to forecast the winning in a matchup between any two given teams during the March Madness tournaments. Our data include 1370 observations with 685 tournament games from 2006 to 2007 to 2016 to 2017 seasons. The results show that neural networks outperformed all other classifiers (67% of accuracy), followed by SVM (65%), kNN (63%), logistic regression (63%), and RF (61%). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the significant challenges in the sports industry is identifying the factors influencing match results and their respective weightage. For appropriate recommendations to the team management and the team players, there is a need to predict the match and quantify the important factors for which prediction models need to be developed. The second thing required is identifying talented and emerging players and performing an associative analysis of the important factors to the match-winning outcome. This paper formulates a hybrid machine learning-clustering-associative rules model. This paper also implements the framework for cricket matches, one of the most popular sports globally watched by billions around the world. We predict the match outcome for One day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty 20 s (T20s) (two formats of Cricket representing fifty over and twenty over versions respectively) adopting state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep neural networks. The variable importance is computed using machine-learning techniques and further statistically validated through the regression model. The emerging talented players are identified by clustering. Association rules are generated for determining the best possible winning outcome. The results show that environmental conditions are equally crucial for determining a match result, as are internal quantitative factors. The model is thus helpful for both team management and for players to improve their winning strategy and also for discovering emerging players to form an unbeatable team. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The importance of young athletes in the field of professional cycling has sky-rocketed during the past years. Nevertheless, the early talent identification of these riders largely remains a subjective assessment. Therefore, an analytical system which automatically detects talented riders based on their freely available youth results should be installed. However, such a system cannot be copied directly from related fields, as large distinctions are observed between cycling and other sports. The aim of this paper is to develop such a data analytical system, which leverages the unique features of each race and thereby focusses on feature engineering, data quality, and visualization. To facilitate the deployment of prediction algorithms in situations without complete cases, we propose an adaptation to the k-nearest neighbours imputation algorithm which uses expert knowledge. Overall, our proposed method correlates strongly with eventual rider performance and can aid scouts in targeting young talents. On top of that, we introduce several model interpretation tools to give insight into which current starting professional riders are expected to perform well and why. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction Two-thirds of athletes (65%) have at least one injury complaint leading to participation restriction (ICPR) in athletics (track and field) during one season. The emerging practice of medicine and public health supported by electronic processes and communication in sports medicine represents an opportunity for developing new injury risk reduction strategies. Modelling and predicting the risk of injury in real-time through artificial intelligence using machine learning techniques might represent an innovative injury risk reduction strategy. Thus, the primary aim of this study will be to analyse the relationship between the level of Injury Risk Estimation Feedback (I-REF) use (average score of athletes' self-declared level of I-REF consideration for their athletics activity) and the ICPR burden during an athletics season. Method and analysis We will conduct a prospective cohort study, called Injury Prediction with Artificial Intelligence (IPredict-AI), over one 38-week athletics season (from September 2022 to July 2023) involving competitive athletics athletes licensed with the French Federation of Athletics. All athletes will be asked to complete daily questionnaires on their athletics activity, their psychological state, their sleep, the level of I-REF use and any ICPR. I-REF will present a daily estimation of the ICPR risk ranging from 0% (no risk for injury) to 100% (maximal risk for injury) for the following day. All athletes will be free to see I-REF and to adapt their athletics activity according to I-REF. The primary outcome will be the ICPR burden over the follow-up (over an athletics season), defined as the number of days lost from training and/or competition due to ICPR per 1000 hours of athletics activity. The relationship between ICPR burden and the level of I-REF use will be explored by using linear regression models. Ethics and dissemination This prospective cohort study was reviewed and approved by the Saint-Etienne University Hospital Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board: IORG0007394, IRBN1062022/CHUSTE). Results of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and in international scientific congresses, as well as to the included participants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Driven by the risk of repetitive head trauma, sensors have been integrated into mouthguards to measure head impacts in contact sports and military activities. These wearable devices, referred to as “instrumented” or “smart” mouthguards are being actively developed by various research groups and organizations. These instrumented mouthguards provide an opportunity to further study and understand the brain biomechanics due to impact. In this study, we present a brain modeling service that can use information from these sensors to predict brain injury metrics in an automated fashion. Methods: We have built a brain modeling platform using several of Amazon's Web Services (AWS) to enable cloud computing and scalability. We use a custom-built cloud-based finite element modeling code to compute the physics-based nonlinear response of the intracranial brain tissue and provide a frontend web application and an application programming interface for groups working on head impact sensor technology to include simulated injury predictions into their research pipeline. Results: The platform results have been validated against experimental data available in literature for brain-skull relative displacements, brain strains and intracranial pressure. The parallel processing capability of the platform has also been tested and verified. We also studied the accuracy of the custom head surfaces generated by Avatar 3D. Conclusion: We present a validated cloud-based computational brain modeling platform that uses sensor data as input for numerical brain models and outputs a quantitative description of brain tissue strains and injury metrics. The platform is expected to generate transparent, reproducible, and traceable brain computing results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present a personalized approach for frequent fitness monitoring in road cycling solely relying on sensor data collected during bike rides and without the need for maximal effort tests. We use competition and training data of three world-class cyclists of Team Jumbo–Visma to construct personalised heart rate models that relate the heart rate during exercise to the pedal power signal. Our model captures the non-trivial dependency between exertion and corresponding response of the heart rate, which we show can be effectively estimated by an exponential kernel. To construct the daily heart rate models that are required for day-to-day fitness estimation, we aggregate all sessions in the previous week and apply sampling. On average, the explained variance of our models is 0.86, which we demonstrate is more than twice as large as for models that ignore the temporal integration involved in the heart’s response to exercise. We show that the fitness of a cyclist can be monitored by tracking developments of parameters of our heart rate models. In particular, we monitor the decay constant of the kernel involved, and also analytically determine virtual aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. We demonstrate that our findings for the virtual anaerobic threshold on average agree with the results of exercise tests. We believe this work is an important step forward in performance optimization by opening up avenues for switching to adaptive training programs that take into account the current physiological state of an athlete. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Acute kidney disease is a serious complication characterized by poor short- and long-term outcomes in the intensive care unit. Impairment in renal function of the kidney significantly increases the mortality rate. Early detection of acute kidney disease could lead to preventive interventions, therefore deep learning systems can detect it before its symptoms and consequences appear. We developed a novel deep learning architecture like Stacked long short-term memory network with pattern mixture approach for kidney injury prediction. A total of 33,754 patients encountered were retrospectively analyzed from the MIMIC-III database. A selection and pattern mixture model was used for preprocessing the time-series data. We compared the proposed result with conventional algorithms like gradient boosted trees and long short-term memory model. Our model was trained on patient time-series data for different time windows and obtained the highest accuracy of 92.4% for 12 h and 92.6% for 24 h. A novel stacked long short-term memory model outperforms the machine learning model, revealing superior performance in predicting kidney injury 24 h before onset. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The frequency of climate-induced disasters (CID) has exhibited a fivefold increase in the last five decades. In terms of CID global impact, around 1.7 billion people were affected in the last decade, and in 2020 alone, 30 million people were displaced due to CID. Furthermore, over the past two decades, 1 million deaths were reported and over $1.7 trillion in damage was attributed to CID. As such, the World Economic Forum, in its 2022 report, has identified climate action failure and extreme weather as the two most severe global risks to be considered over the next decade. Given the uncertainty and complexity associated with predicting CID frequencies and related impacts, the use of descriptive-, predictive- and prescriptive data analytics is key. To demonstrate the power of data analytics in predicting CID impacts, this work focuses on developing a data-driven machine learning model that predicts tornado-induced injuries based on a diverse set of input features ranging from hazard-, social-, geographic-, and climate-related features together with attributes related to community vulnerability, risk and resilience. These input features are then used to train and test various machine learning-based prediction models utilizing diverse techniques including decision trees, ensemble methods, and artificial neural networks. These models are subsequently evaluated to select the most significant features and the best performing model. In addition, several variable importance techniques are used to evaluate the dominance of all features and develop a model considering the most influential features. The results show that the best performing model had a testing accuracy of 83%. In addition, the results highlighted the apparent relationship between hazard-related attributes and tornadoes’ injury predictions. The developed approach is a step forward in harnessing the power of machine learning for improving our adaptation, preparedness, and planning towards global CID resilience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traffic safety is a critical aspect of transportation. Transportation agencies and researchers have been continuously making an effort to ensure minimal error margins in the road system. There is a growing interest in the Southeast Michigan region because of the active role of original equipment manufacturers in spurring research in the new mobility field and autonomous vehicle technology. As new jobs are created and commuting trips increase, traffic safety becomes even more important. Thus, this study presents one of the first efforts to study crash patterns for Southeast Michigan using machine learning models to analyze and predict crash severity in the region based on various contributing factors. We combine a three-step method of correlation analysis, machine learning predictive models, and spatial analysis to develop a rigid schema for crash prediction. Results show that decision tree classifiers provide accurate predictions and rapid computations. Also, spatial plots of predicted injury severities reveal disproportionate errors in model predictions at intersections prompting the need to stratify the crash data for further analyses. This significantly improves severe injury predictions at non-intersection locations and highlights pedestrians as a main important feature. The converse holds for intersections that identify motorcycles as the main feature for severity prediction. Further results are elucidated in this paper. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: By analyzing external workloads with machine learning models (ML), it is now possible to predict injuries, but with a moderate accuracy. The increment of the prediction ability is nowadays mandatory to reduce the high number of false positives. The aim of this study was to investigate if players’ blood sample profiles could increase the predictive ability of the models trained only on external training workloads. Method: Eighteen elite soccer players competing in Italian league (Serie B) during the seasons 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 took part in this study. Players’ blood samples parameters (i.e., Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, ferritin, and sideremia) were recorded through the two soccer seasons to group them into two main groups using a non-supervised ML algorithm (k-means). Additionally to external workloads data recorded every training or match day using a GPS device (K-GPS 10 Hz, K-Sport International, Italy), this grouping was used as a predictor for injury risk. The goodness of ML models trained were tested to assess the influence of blood sample profile to injury prediction. Results: Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, testosterone, and ferritin were the most important features that allowed to profile players and to analyze the response to external workloads for each type of player profile. Players’ blood samples’ characteristics permitted to personalize the decision-making rules of the ML models based on external workloads reaching an accuracy of 63%. This approach increased the injury prediction ability of about 15% compared to models that take into consideration only training workloads’ features. The influence of each external workload varied in accordance with the players’ blood sample characteristics and the physiological demands of a specific period of the season. Conclusion: Field experts should hence not only monitor the external workloads to assess the status of the players, but additional information derived from individuals’ characteristics permits to have a more complete overview of the players well-being. In this way, coaches could better personalize the training program maximizing the training effect and minimizing the injury risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of exciting applications in augmented reality, sports analytics, rehabilitation-healthcare, haptics, etc. This article presents NeuroPose, a system that shows the feasibility of 3-D finger motion tracking using a platform of wearable electromyography (EMG) sensors. EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However, converting the sensor information to 3-D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Toward solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), encoder-decoder networks, and ResNets to extract 3-D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3-D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. In addition, this article validates the feasibility of mirrored bilateral training approach with applications in prosthetic devices. Finally, NeuroPose is comprehensively evaluated on both low-end and recent smartphones with a processing latency of 0.019 s and low energy overhead. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The growing intensity and frequency of matches in professional football leagues are related to the increasing physical player load. An incorrect training model results in over- or undertraining, which is related to a raised probability of an injury. This research focuses on predicting non-contact lower body injuries coming from over- or undertraining. The purpose of this analysis was to create decision-making models based on data collected during both training and match, which will enable the preparation of a tool to model the load and report the increased risk of injury for a given player in the upcoming microcycle. For this purpose, three decision-making methods were implemented. Rule-based and fuzzy rule-based methods were prepared based on expert understanding. As a machine learning baseline XGBoost algorithm was considered. Taking into account the dataset used containing parameters related to the external load of the player, it is possible to predict the risk of injury with a certain precision, depending on the method used. The most promising results were achieved by the machine learning method XGBoost algorithm (Precision 92.4%, Recall 96.5%, and F1-score 94.4%). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Injury prediction models enables to improve trauma outcomes for motor vehicle occupants in accurate decision-making and early transport to appropriate trauma centers. This study aims to investigate the injury severity prediction (ISP) capability in machine-learning analytics based on five-different regional Level 1 trauma center enrolled patients in Korea. We study car crash-related injury data of 1417 patients enrolled in the Korea In-Depth Accident Study database from January 2011 to April 2021. Severe injury classification was defined using an Injury Severity Score of 15 or greater. A planar crash was considered by excluding rollovers to compromise an accurate prediction. Furthermore, dissimilarities of the collision partner component based on vehicle segmentation were assumed for crash incompatibility. To handle class-imbalanced clinical datasets, we used four data-sampling techniques (i.e., class-weighting, resampling, synthetic minority oversampling, and adaptive synthetic sampling). Machine-learning analytics based on logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a multilayer perceptron model were used for the evaluations. Each model was executed using five-fold cross-validation to solve overfitting consistent with the hyperparameters tuned to improve model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.896. Additionally, the present ISP model showed an under-triage rate of 6.1%. The Delta-V, age and Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) were significant predictors. The results demonstrated that the data-balanced XGBoost model achieved a reliable performance on injury severity classification of emergency department patients. This finding considers ISP model selection, which affected prediction performance based on overall predictor variables. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Analyzing tactical patterns in invasion games using multi-agent spatiotemporal data is a challenging task at the intersection of computer and sports science. A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs, an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance. The theoretical findings and the proposed method provide insights and a strong methodological alternative for all classification, prediction or pattern recognition applications in the areas of collective movement analysis, automated match analysis, and performance analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The salient event recognition of soccer matches in the next-generation Internet of Things (Nx-IoT) environment aims to analyze the performance of players/teams by the sports analytics and managerial staff. The embedded Nx-IoT devices carried by the soccer players during the match capture and transmit data to an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted computing platform. The interconnectivity of data acquisition devices with an AI-assisted computing platform in the Nx-IoT environment will not only allow the spectators to track the formation of their favorite players during a soccer match but will also enable the managerial staff to evaluate the players' performance in the soccer match as well as in practice sessions. This Nx-IoT-enabled salient event detection feature can be provided to spectators and sports' managerial staff as a financial technology (FinTech) service. In this article, we propose an efficient deep-learning-based framework for multiperson salient soccer event recognition in IoT-enabled FinTech. The proposed framework performs event recognition in three steps: 1) frames preprocessing; 2) frame-level discriminative features extraction; and 3) high-level events recognition in soccer videos. Moreover, we introduce a new soccer video events (SVE) data set containing videos of six salient events of soccer games. To provide a strong baseline, we evaluate our newly created SVE data set using different traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We also perform event recognition on untrimmed soccer videos using our proposed framework and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods. The obtained results validate the suitability of our proposed framework for salient event recognition in Nx-IoT environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The characterization of toxic compounds in terms of chemical structure is important because compounds can be metabolized to toxic substances in the liver. Traditional machine learning approaches have had limited success in predicting DILI, and emerging deep graph neural network (GNN) models are yet powerful enough to predict DILI. In this study, we developed a completely different approach, supervised subgraph mining (SSM), a strategy to mine explicit subgraph features by iteratively updating individual graph transitions to maximize DILI fidelity. Our method outperformed previous methods including state-of-the-art GNN tools in classifying DILI on two different datasets: DILIst and TDC-benchmark. We also combined the subgraph features by using SMARTS-based frequent structural pattern matching and associated them with drugs’ ATC code. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To precisely track and record player scores in real-time, this article presents an inventive AI-based automated basketball scoring system that makes use of computer vision and deep learning techniques. Using a variety of libraries, including TensorFlow, Fast RCNN, OpenCV, Yolov4, Yolov7, and the mmpose tool, the system uses pose recognition, basketball and hoop detection, and tracking techniques. This technology increases the effectiveness of player training by updating scoreboards and game data on its own. The suggested approach has an average accuracy of 78.74% for identifying objects, 83.75% for detecting shots, and 80% for identifying the shooter. The accuracy of the scoring system in allocating scores to shots is 66.67%. This technology is a significant development in the field of sports analytics, improving the experience of analyzing basketball games and maybe opening up new applications for real-time monitoring situations and other sports.

	abstract = {Injuries in professional soccer are a major problem for both players and clubs. Serious injuries have the potential to cause detrimental effects on a player's career, or even end it prematurely. Clubs also suffer when key players are injured; their game tactics may need to be changed to better fit the limited team members available, which can severely affect performance, especially in competitive leagues. The goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a large dataset to train an accurate Machine Learning model to predict injuries in professional-level soccer. Machine Learning algorithms used to solve this problem have historically had small datasets, which are prone to variance and unreliable results. Therefore, a larger dataset will be constructed from publicly available data to prove that a reliable injury prediction tool can be created. The data in this study will span multiple years and include data about player minutes, age, appearances, and whether they were recovering from an injury. The results of the study show that an injury prediction tool using Machine Learning is practical for use in professional-level soccer to help teams predict and prevent non-contact injuries sustained by athletes. Further, the quality of these Machine Learning tools will increase as more accurate data collection technology is acquired by teams. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

With the popularity of wearable devices and the development of data science, machine learning is being introduced into the field of sports injury prevention, providing a new perspective for the prevention of sports injury. To assist students in understanding the safety aspects of soccer sports, addressing the potential risks associated with competition and confrontation in soccer activities, and providing guidance for students to engage in exercise safely and healthily, this paper presents a systematical injury risk analysis and injury prediction model based on machine learning algorithms for campus soccer players. The proposed data-driven soccer sports injury prediction algorithm is based on sufficient exercise data collection, and the risk of sports injury in the future training cycle is predicted based on the characteristic attributes of key exercise load. Based on the experimental results, the proposed Support Vector Machine based algorithm can accurately predict the injury, and the accuracy is close to 94%. It can provide valuable support to coaches and help to reduce the incidence of injuries among youth soccer players. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To tackle the difficult task of predicting injuries, initial attempts have been made to apply machine learning methods to complex, multivariate sports data. However, no machine learning model has emerged which has good performance and generalisability to multiple datasets. Focusing on explainable machine learning, this paper discusses possible limitations in common approaches to injury prediction, and investigates methods that might be able to overcome these limitations. In particular, we first examine the value that can be obtained by including daily records of psychological variables to provide a multi-modal perspective on athletes. Secondly, we consider whether models that focus on learning from local rather than global patterns in the data are better suited to modelling injuries. We explain how the diversity of injuries in terms of severity, duration, type (chronic versus acute) and context may make local models preferable. The local modelling approaches we consider include subgroup discovery, anomaly detection and casebased classification. Since the proposed approaches threaten to increase the model complexity, we take great care to ensure that explainability is maintained, and describe the ways in which each of our methods is explainable. This leads to a set of explainable, local models. To provide an empirical basis for the investigations, we perform a series of computational studies using data obtained by daily recording of professional association football players in the Netherlands over a period of two seasons. These studies aim to expand the currently limited literature on applying explainable ML methods to injury prediction. Our results indicate that predicting injuries is very difficult in general, while the focus of this paper is mainly on providing insights on explainability and interpretability. Therefore, alongside results detailing the performance of various machine learning models, we also include multiple examples of explanations that can be extracted using our proposed methods, which may support actionability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cricket is a popular sport with complex gameplay and numerous variables that contribute to team performance. In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, aiming to extract valuable insights from large volumes of cricket data. Cricket has many fans in India. With a strong fan following, many try to use their cricket intuition to predict the outcome of a match. A set of rules and a points system govern the game. The venue and the performance of each player greatly affect the outcome of the match. The game is difficult to predict accurately as the various components are closely related. The CRR (Current Run Rate) approach is used to predict the final score of the first innings of a cricket match. Total points are calculated by multiplying the average number of runs scored in each over by the total number of overs. For ODI cricket, these methods are useless as the game can change very quickly regardless of the current run rate. The game may be decided by 1 or 2 overs. For more accurate score predictions, a system is needed that can more accurately predict the outcome of an inning. This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict scores and classify players based on their roles in the squad. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of cricket matches, including player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest regression models are employed to predict scores. Additionally, player categorization is performed using a classification approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in enhancing performance analysis and decision-making in the game of cricket. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports predictions has gained popularity as a topic of study thanks to the development of sports analytics and the accessibility of extensive and sophisticated match data. In this paper, a machine learning-based (ML) strategy for forecasting football match results is presented. In the past, the number of goals scored by each team in a football (FB) game served as a benchmark for assessing a team's performance and projecting future outcomes to forecast the results of football games, such as win, draw, or defeat. However, there are significant discrepancies between a team's performance and the number of goals scored or conceded throughout many games because the number of goals scored during a match contains a significant random element.The goal of this study is to create an accurate and dependable prediction model that will help fans, analysts, and bet enthusiasts make wise selections. The selection of features, treatment of data that is imbalanced and the generalization of models constitute significant issues that are addressed in this paper. The system learns patterns from previous encounters and player attributes to develop predictions for upcoming games. Various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and regression, are experimented with. The main goal of this research is to investigate various Machine Learning techniques to forecast football game results utilizing in-game match events and individual and team statistics off the field.As football remains a globally popular sport, the integration of machine learning for match prediction offers an exciting avenue for enthusiasts to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of the game. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Even though match playing is an important part of the professional tennis player's career development, sports injuries will happen if the player plays too many tournaments. By analyzing historical data and studying cases where players retired during matches, we have been able to identify specific scheduling patterns that correlate with a higher risk of injury. As a result, we propose a dynamic tennis injury prediction model as well as an explainable pattern-mining method to obtain player-specific injury patterns based on historical data. Both approaches take into account features such as the player's physical condition, match performance, injury history, and recent tournament schedule. With these comprehensive approaches, we aim to balance competitive success and the preservation of players' well-being. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated tremendous progress in many domains, especially with the vast deployment of machine and deep learning. Recently, AI has been introduced to the sports domain including the football (soccer) industry with applications in injury prediction and tactical analysis. However, the fact remains that the more complex an AI model is, the less explainable it becomes. Its black-box nature makes it difficult for human operators to understand its results, interpret its decisions and ultimately trust the model itself. This problem is magnified when the decisions and results suggested by an AI model affect the functioning of complex and multi-layered systems and entities, with a football club being such an example. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged for making an AI model more explainable, understandable and interpretable, thus assisting the creation of human-centered AI models. This paper discusses how XAI could be applied in the football domain to benefit both the players and the club. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As the core of the system, the driver injury prediction model can predict the driver's injury category in time and send the injury situation to the emergency medical institution. The medical institution arranges the optimal rescue team and hospital according to the injury situation obtained by the algorithm, which greatly reduces the economic loss and mortality caused by the accident. This paper mainly studies the severity of driver injury. Using the annual data from 2019 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), from which 10 variables such as driver injury, driver age and height were extracted, and the correlation between each independent variable and dependent variable was analyzed to increase the reliability and prediction accuracy of the network model adopted in this paper. In this paper, the combination of genetic algorithm and BP neural network was used to build a driver injury prediction model with machine learning. Compared with support vector machines (SVM), long short-term memory (LSTM), traditional BP neural network and logistic linear model, the accuracy was improved by 11.78%, 6.54%, 7.08% and 13.78% respectively. The research results can be used to improve the algorithm and performance of the enterprise call center in the advanced vehicle collision automatic call system, and finally can effectively improve the efficiency of accident rescue. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In this study, we explore the potential benefits of integrating natural cognitive systems (medical professionals' expertise) and artificial cognitive systems (deep learning models) in the realms of medical image analysis and sports injury prediction. We focus on analyzing medical images of athletes to gain valuable insights into their health status. Methods: To synergize the strengths of both natural and artificial cognitive systems, we employ the ResNet50-BiGRU model and introduce an attention mechanism. Our goal is to enhance the performance of medical image feature extraction and motion injury prediction. This integrated approach aims to achieve precise identification of anomalies in medical images, particularly related to muscle or bone damage. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on four medical image datasets, specifically pertaining to skeletal and muscle injuries. We use performance indicators such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, confirming the robustness of our approach in sports injury analysis. Discussion: Our research contributes significantly by providing an effective deep learning-driven method that harnesses both natural and artificial cognitive systems. By combining human expertise with advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive understanding of athletes' health status. This approach holds potential implications for enhancing sports injury prevention, improving diagnostic accuracy, and tailoring personalized treatment plans for athletes, ultimately promoting better overall health and performance outcomes. Despite advancements in medical image analysis and sports injury prediction, existing systems often struggle to identify subtle anomalies and provide precise injury risk assessments, underscoring the necessity of a more integrated and comprehensive approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The present study proposes an artificial intelligence solution for acute kidney injury prediction in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: Data were collected from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, area under the precision–recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. Results: Logistic regression, XGBoost, and XGBoost with severity scores were used to predict acute kidney injury risk using all features. The XGBoost-based acute kidney injury predictive models including XGBoost and XGBoost+severity scores model showed greater accuracy, recall, precision AUC, AUC-PR, and F1 score compared to logistic regression. Conclusion: The XGBoost model obtained better risk prediction for acute kidney injury in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit than the traditional logistic regression model, suggesting that machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to improve the development and validation of predictive models in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {My country is currently in a new era of industrial revolution and technological development, among which the most representative is the rapid development of information technology. And the action plan has been formulated, and it is pointed out that it is necessary to deeply integrate the real economy and artificial intelligence, the Internet and digital China, as well as the smart society and big data. As the most critical part of community governance, the complexity and difficulty of community sports center governance is relatively high. Therefore, one of the key goals that all sectors of society are currently concerned about is how to build and develop community sports through more advanced technical means center. The innovative governance community sports center must effectively combine and integrate the current advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data, so that the level of community governance can be effectively improved. This paper draws on the academic background of 'governance' in the field of public management. Different from social management, 'governance' mainly reflects the administrative aspect, the cooperation between the government and all sectors of society, while the traditional social management mainly highlights the state's administrative management. It reflects the concept that the government's management power is inviolable and unshareable, which is also very different from the development direction of the gradual liberalization of the administrative power advocated by the Chinese government. Therefore, the effective way to solve various social problems at this stage is to change the concept of social management to community governance, and this approach has also been supported and valued by the government in recent years. The research shows that the management efficiency of community sports facilities can be effectively improved by optimizing the community sports governance system, making full use of the convenience brought by information resources, and using its own advanced technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The field of quantitative analytics has transformed the world of sports over the last decade. To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters, it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the 2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, identifying players with injury risk through physical fitness assessment has become a hot topic in sports science research. Although practitioners have conducted many studies on the relationship between physical fitness and the likelihood of injury, the relationship between the two remains indeterminate. Consequently, this study utilized machine learning to preliminary investigate the relationship between individual physical fitness tests and injury risk, aiming to identify whether patterns of physical fitness change have an impact on injury risk. Methods: This study conducted a retrospective analysis by extracting the records of 17 young female basketball players from the sport-specific physical fitness monitoring and injury registration database in Fujian Province. Sports-specific physical fitness tests included physical performance, physiological, biochemical, and subjective perceived responses. The data for each player was standardized individually using Z-scores. Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques and edited nearest neighbor algorithms were used to sample the training set to address the negative impact of class imbalance on model performance. Feature extraction was performed on the dataset using linear discriminant analysis, and the prediction model was constructed using the cost-sensitive neural network. Results: The 10 replicate 5-fold stratified cross-validation showed that the lower limb non-contact injury prediction model based on the cost-sensitive neural network had achieved good discrimination and calibration (average Precision: 0.6360; average Recall: 0.8700; average F2-Score: 0.7980; average AUC: 0.8590; average Brier-score: 0.1020), which could be well applied in training practice. According to the attribution analysis, agility and speed were important physical attributes that affect youth female basketball players’ non-contact lower limb injury risk. Specifically, there was enhance in the performance of the 1-min double under, accompanied by an increase in urinary ketone and urinary blood levels following the agility test. The 3/4 basketball court sprint performance improved, while urinary protein and RPE levels decreased after the speed test. Conclusion: The sport-specific physical fitness change pattern can impact the lower limb non-contact injury risk of young female basketball players in Fujian Province, specifically in terms of agility and speed. These findings will provide valuable insights for planning athletes’ physical training programs, managing fatigue, and preventing injuries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sensor-based analytics is a science of capturing the essentials of human motion and has been extensively used in sports by attaching external sensors to players for deriving meaningful insights, thereby improving game-playing quality. This paper presents the work towards developing a wearable Body Sensor Network(BSN) for Table Tennis(TT) stroke detection through self-learned features. By capturing acceleration and rotation parameters using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors mounted on the player forearm and shoulder while playing a TT stroke, a neural network has been trained to predict forehand and backhand shots. The model runs on Arduino Nano 33 BLE and achieves a real-time prediction accuracy of 90.7%. Also, a memory-efficient Tensorflow-based Quantization Aware Training(QAT) model, with up to 4 times reduction in model size, has been developed to demonstrate comparable prediction accuracy with size reduction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The occurrence of myocardial injury, a grave complication post complete mesocolic excision (CME), profoundly impacts the immediate and long-term prognosis of patients. The aim of this inquiry was to conceive a machine learning model that can recognize preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative high-risk factors and predict the onset of myocardial injury following CME. Patients and Methods: This study included 1198 colon cancer patients, 133 of whom experienced myocardial injury after surgery. Thirty-six distinct variables were gathered, encompassing patient demographics, medical history, preoperative examination character-istics, surgery type, and intraoperative details. Four machine learning algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), were employed to fabricate the model, and k-fold cross-validation, ROC curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and external validation were employed to evaluate it. Results: Out of the four predictive models employed, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best performance. The ROC curve findings indicated that the XGBoost model exhibited remarkable predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.997 in the training set and 0.956 in the validation set. For internal validation, the k-fold cross-validation method was utilized, and the XGBoost model was shown to be steady. Furthermore, the calibration curves demonstrated the XGBoost model’s high predictive capability. The DCA curve revealed higher benefit rates for patients who underwent interventional treatment under the XGBoost model. The AUC value for the external validation set was 0.74, which indicated that the XGBoost prediction model possessed good extrapolative capacity. Conclusion: The myocardial injury prediction model for patients undergoing CME that was developed using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm in this study demonstrates both high predictive accuracy and clinical utility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In epidemiological research on spine surgery, machine learning represents a promising new area. It is made up of several algorithms that work together to identify patterns in the data. Machine learning provides many benefits over traditional regression techniques, including a lower necessity for a priori predictor information and a higher capacity for managing huge datasets. Recent research has made significant progress toward using machine learning more effectively in spinal cord injury (SCI). Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injuries. Non-traumatic spinal cord injuries often reflect degenerative spine conditions that cause spinal cord compression, such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. This article proposes a novel correlated graph model (CGM) that adopts correlated learning to predict various outcomes published in traumatic and non-traumatic SCI. In the studies mentioned, machine learning is used for several purposes, including imaging analysis and epidemiological data set prediction. We discuss how these clinical predictive models are based on machine learning compared to traditional statistical prediction models. Finally, we outline the actions that must be taken in the future for machine learning to be a more prevalent statistical analysis method in SCI © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence and its subcategories of machine learning and deep learning are gaining increasing importance and attention in the context of sports research. This has also meant that the number of corresponding publications has become complex and unmanageably large in human terms. In the current state of the research field, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports, and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps in the research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Airway obstruction is one of the crucial causes of death in trauma patients during the first aid. It is extremely challenging to accurately treat a great deal of casualties with airway obstruction in hospitals. The diagnosis of airway obstruction in an emergency mostly relies on the medical experience of physicians. In this paper, we propose the feature selection approach genetic algorithm-mean decrease impurity (GA-MDI) to effectively minimize the number of features as well as ensure the accuracy of prediction. Furthermore, we design a multi-modal neural network, called fully convolutional network with squeeze-and-excitation and multilayer perceptron (FCN-SE + MLP), to help physicians to predict the severity of airway obstruction. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection approach and multi-modal model on the emergency medical database from the Chinese General Hospital of the PLA. The experimental results show that GA-MDI outperforms the existing feature selection algorithms, while it is also validated that the model FCN-SE + MLP can effectively and accurately achieve the prediction of the severity of airway obstruction, which can assist clinicians in making treatment decisions for airway obstruction casualties.

The primary aim was to cross-validate a previously developed classification algorithm using a different sample, while a secondary aim was to examine its ability to predict future ACL injuries. The examined outcome measure was ‘healthy-limb’ class membership probability, which was compared between a cohort of athletes without previous or future (No Injury) previous (PACL) and future ACL injury (FACL). The No Injury group had significantly higher probabilities than the PACL (p < 0.001; medium effect) and FACL group (p ≤ 0.045; small effect). The ability to predict group membership was poor for the PACL (area under curve [AUC]; 0.61<AUC<0.62) and FACL group (0.57<AUC<0.59). The ACL injury incidence proportion was highest in athletes with probabilities below 0.20 (9.4%; +2.7% to baseline), while athletes with probabilities above 0.80 had an incidence proportion of 4.1% (−2.6%). While findings that a low probability might represent an increase in injury risk on a group level, it is not sensitive enough for injury screening to predict a future injury on the individual level. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Delays in the identification of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients are a major barrier to the development of effective interventions for treatment. A recent study described a series of models that outperformed previously published models in predicting acute kidney injury up to 48 h in advance, including a recurrent neural network that achieved state-of-the-art performance (area under the curve 0.92) and a gradient-boosted decision tree model that was close behind (area under the curve 0.89). Because these models were trained in a population of US veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its generalizability to other health systems where the populations are more sex balanced. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how well an acute kidney injury model trained in a population of US veterans performs in females at the Veterans Affairs and the extent to which its performance generalizes to a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting acute kidney injury in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of acute kidney injury and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of acute kidney injury. We demonstrate that, while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of characterizing the generalizability of artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Attempts to better understand the relationship between training and competition load and injury in football are essential for helping to understand adaptation to training programmes, assessing fatigue and recovery, and minimising the risk of injury and illness. To this end, technological advancements have enabled the collection of multiple points of data for use in analysis and injury prediction. The full breadth of available data has, however, only recently begun to be explored using suitable statistical methods. Advances in automatic and interactive data analysis with the help of machine learning are now being used to better establish the intricacies of the player load and injury relationship. In this article, we examine this recent research, describing the analyses and algorithms used, reporting the key findings, and comparing model fit. To date, the vast array of variables used in analysis as proxy indicators of player load, alongside differences in approach to key aspects of data treatment—such as response to data imbalance, model fitting, and a lack of multi-season data—limit a systematic evaluation of findings and the drawing of a unified conclusion. If, however, the limitations of current studies can be addressed, machine learning has much to offer the field and could in future provide solutions to the training load and injury paradox through enhanced and systematic analysis of athlete data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Pressure injury has always been a focus and difficulty of nursing. With the development of nursing informatization, a large amount of structured and unstructured data has been generated, and it is difficult for traditional methods to utilize these data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence and nursing, it has become a new trend to apply machine learning algorithms to build pressure injury prediction models to manage pressure injuries. However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of the method and which of a large number of algorithms for machine learning is more applicable to pressure injuries. Objective: This review aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms for pressure injury management, to further evaluate and compare pressure injury prediction models constructed by numerous machine learning algorithms, and to derive evidence for the best algorithms for predicting and managing pressure injuries. Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic electronic search was conducted in the EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. We included all retrospective diagnostic accuracy trials and prospective diagnostic accuracy trials constructing a predictive model by machine learning for pressure injuries up to December 2021. Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The network meta-analysis was conducted using statistical software R and STATA. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Result: Twenty-five clinical diagnostic trials with a total of 237397 participants were identified in this review. The results of our study revealed that pressure injury machine learning models can effectively predict these injuries. Combining the algorithms separately yields the main results: decision trees (sensitivity: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.84, specificity: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96, diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]: 18, 95% CI: 7 to 49, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), logistic regression (sensitivity: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80, specificity: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89, DOR: 12, 95% CI: 9 to 17, AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.87), neural networks (sensitivity: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86, specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87, DOR: 9, 95% CI: 5 to 19, AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.85), random forests (sensitivity: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.95, specificity: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99, DOR: 56, 95% CI: 3 to 1258, AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), support vector machines (sensitivity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90, specificity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.93, DOR: 19, 95% CI: 6 to 54, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.90). According to the analysis of ROC and AUC values, random forest is the best algorithm for the prediction model of pressure injury. Conclusions: This review revealed that machine learning algorithms are generally effective in predicting pressure injuries, and after data merging, the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for pressure injury prediction. Further well-designed diagnostic controlled trials are recommended to strengthen the current evidence. Registration number (PROSPERO): CRD42021276993. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress in deep learning-based computer vision has opened unprecedented possibilities in computing various high-level analytics for sports. Artificial intelligence techniques such as predictive analysis, automatic highlight generation, and assistant coaching have been applied to improve performance and decision-making for teams and players. To perform any high-level analysis from a game match, collecting the locations (where) and identities (who) of players is crucial and challenging. In this paper, a universal JErsey number DEtector (JEDE) for player identification is presented that predicts players' bounding boxes and keypoints, along with bounding boxes and classes of jersey digits and numbers in an end-to-end manner. Instead of generating digit proposals from pre-defined anchors, JEDE predicts more robust proposals guided by players' features and pose estimation. Moreover, a dataset is collected from soccer and basketball matches with annotations on players' bounding boxes and body keypoints, and jersey digits' bounding boxes and labels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the collected dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Both quantitative and qualitative results also demonstrate JEDE's superior practicality and generalizability over different sports. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Twenty-two ultrarunners participated in the study. The risk of acquiring AKI was evaluated by a support vector machine (SVM) model, which is a statistical model commonly used for classification tasks. The inputs of the SVM model were the data collected 1 hour before the race, and the output of the SVM model was the decision of acquiring AKI. Our best AKI prediction model achieved accuracy of 96% in training and 90% in cross-validation tests. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 90% and 100%, respectively.

	abstract = {In recent years, a growing body of research has started to explore applying artificial intelligence to the sports industry due to the availability of data and the advancement of techniques. Such applications not only play an important role during matches but also have a great influence on the training stage. However, applying deep learning techniques to sports analytics has several technical challenges, which also remain untouched in badminton analytics as there is no public dataset of stroke event records. Therefore, this dissertation intends to explore challenging research questions and application issues that have not been addressed for benefiting both the research and badminton communities. To achieve the objectives, we, for the first time, propose a unified badminton language to describe the process of the shot, which enables us to conduct downstream applications. Specifically, our first task is to measure the win probability of each shot in badminton matches by considering long-term and short-term dependencies. Second, we introduce a framework with two encoder-decoder extractors and a position-aware fusion network to forecast the possible tactics of players, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. To provide the transparency of these models, we aim to design a post-hoc explainer by computing feature attributions with Shapley values as the third task. In this manner, researchers can investigate model behaviors for advanced improvement, and the badminton community benefits from coaching the players and determining the strategies.

	abstract = {Sports analytics benefits from recent advances in machine learning providing a competitive advantage for teams or individuals. One important task in this context is the performance measurement of individual players to provide reports and log files for subsequent analysis. During sport events like basketball, this involves the re-identification of players during a match either from multiple camera viewpoints or from a single camera viewpoint at different times. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the out-standing zero-shot performance of pre-Trained CLIP models to the domain of player re-identification. For this purpose we reformulate the contrastive language-To-image pre-Training approach from CLIP to a contrastive image-To-image training approach using the InfoNCE loss as training objective. Unlike previous work, our approach is entirely class-Agnostic and benefits from large-scale pre-Training. With a fine-Tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 model we achieve 98.44% mAP on the MMSports 2022 Player Re-Identification challenge. Furthermore we show that the CLIP Vision Transformers have already strong OCR capabilities to identify useful player features like shirt numbers in a zero-shot manner without any fine-Tuning on the dataset. By applying the Score-CAM algorithm we visualise the most important image regions that our fine-Tuned model identifies when calculating the similarity score between two images of a player. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, the task of detecting and recognizing the actions of a human has been delegated to some form of neural network processing camera or wearable sensor data. Due to the degree to which the camera can be affected by lighting and wearable sensors scantiness, neither one modality can capture the required data to perform the task confidently. That being the case, range sensors, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can complement the process to perceive the environment more robustly. Most recently, researchers have been exploring ways to apply convolutional neural networks to 3-D data. These methods typically rely on a single modality and cannot draw on information from complementing sensor streams to improve accuracy. This article proposes a framework to tackle human activity recognition by leveraging the benefits of sensor fusion and multimodal machine learning. Given both RGB and point cloud data, our method describes the activities being performed by subjects using regions with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and a 3-D modified Fisher vector network. Evaluated on a custom captured multimodal dataset demonstrates that the model outputs remarkably accurate human activity classification (90%). Furthermore, this framework can be used for sports analytics, understanding social behavior, surveillance, and perhaps most notably by autonomous vehicles (AVs) to data-driven decision-making policies in urban areas and indoor environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global expansion of the sports betting industry has brought the prediction of outcomes of sport events into the foreground of scientific research. In this work, soccer outcome prediction methods are evaluated, focusing on the Greek Super League. Data analysis, including data cleaning, Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), feature engineering methods and data augmentation is conducted. The most important features are used to train five machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), LogitBoost (LB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB). For comparative reasons, the best model is also tested on the English Premier League and the Dutch Eredivisie, exploiting data statistics from six seasons from 2014 to 2020. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning are also tested by encoding tabular data to images, using 10-fold cross-validation, after applying grid and randomized hyperparameter tuning: DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and ResNet101V2. This is the first time the Greek Super League is investigated in depth, providing important features and comparative performance between several machine and deep learning models, as well as between other leagues. Experimental results in all cases demonstrate that the most accurate prediction model is the CB, reporting 67.73% accuracy, while the Greek Super League is the most predictable league. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Goal: This paper presents an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) system to analyze and train Executive Functions (EFs) of soccer players. EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Injuries are one of the most significant issues for elite football players. Consequently, elite football clubs have been consistently interested in having practical, interpretable, and usable models as decision-making support for technical staff. This study aimed to analyze predictive modeling of injury risk based on body composition variables and selected physical fitness tests for elite football players through a sports season. The sample comprised 36 male elite football players who competed in the First Portuguese Soccer League in the 2020/2021 season. The models were calculated based on 22 independent variables that included players’ information, body composition, physical fitness, and one dependent variable, the number of injuries per season. In the net elastic analysis, the variables that best predicted injury risk were sectorial positions (defensive and forward), body height, sit-and-reach performance, 1 min number of push-ups, handgrip strength, and 35 m linear speed. This study considered multiple-input single-output regression-type models. The analysis showed that the most accurate model presented in this work generates an error of RMSE = 0.591. Our approach opens a novel perspective for injury prevention and training monitorization. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to identify risk factors associated with injury prediction in elite soccer players, as this is a rising topic that requires several analyses performed in different contexts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While there has been a growing interest in sports analysis in recent years, much research first focused on a classical statistical approach and later on an artificial intelligence approach. This article aims instead to propose a causal inference approach to sports analysis. In particular, the present article intends to review the famous four-factor model proposed by Dean Oliver for assessing the winning ability of National Basketball Association (NBA) teams through a causal inference approach. A structural equation model is used to validate Oliver’s model. The present paper considers the winning percentage and the factors’ statistics over entire seasons from 1996-1997 to 2020-2021. The statistics for the 2019-2020 season are considered only on a subset of the games. This is because the games played in the Orlando bubble under the particular COVID-19 situation have been regarded as outliers compared to the games played in the other NBA seasons, hence they have not been taken into account. The second goal of the article is to analyse if the fitting ability of the four-factor model changes when it is fitted over the pre-2021 and post-2010 basketball eras datasets, considering the year 2010 as the turning point for the NBA playing style. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: This cross-sectional research aims to develop reliable predictive short-term prediction models to predict the number of RTIs in Northeast China through comparative studies. Methodology: Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Facebook Prophet (Prophet) models were used for time series prediction of the number of RTIs inpatients. The three models were trained using data from 2015 to 2019, and their prediction accuracy was compared using data from 2020 as a test set. The parameters of the SARIMA model were determined using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). The LSTM uses linear as the activation function, the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function and the Adam optimizer to construct the model, while the Prophet model is built on the Python platform. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to measure the predictive performance of the model. Findings: In this research, the LSTM model had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the Prophet model, and the SARIMA model had the lowest prediction accuracy. The trend in medical expenditure of RTIs inpatients overlapped highly with the number of RTIs inpatients. Conclusion: By adjusting the activation function and optimizer, the LSTM predicts the number of RTIs inpatients more accurately and robustly than other models. Compared with other models, LSTM models still show excellent prediction performance in the face of data with seasonal and drastic changes. The LSTM can provide a better basis for planning and management in healthcare administration. Implication: The results of this research show that it is feasible to accurately forecast the demand for healthcare resources with seasonal distribution using a suitable forecasting model. The prediction of specific medical service volumes will be an important basis for medical management to allocate medical and health resources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We identified multiple approaches in the area of Machine Perception, Machine Learning and Modeling, Planning and Optimization as well as Interaction and Intervention, holding a potential for improving training and competition. Secondly, we discover the present status of AI use in elite sports. Therefore, in addition to another literature review, we interviewed leading sports scientist, which are closely connected to the main national service institute for elite sports in their countries. The analysis of this literature review and the interviews show that the most activity is carried out in the methodical categories of signal and image processing. However, projects in the field of modeling & planning have become increasingly popular within the last years. Based on these two perspectives, we extract deficits, issues and opportunities and summarize them in six key challenges faced by the sports analytics community. These challenges include data collection, controllability of an AI by the practitioners and explainability of AI results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents ssLOTR (self-supervised learning on the rings), a system that shows the feasibility of designing self-supervised learning based techniques for 3D finger motion tracking using a custom-designed wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor with a minimal overhead of labeled training data. Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-Time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion. Extensive evaluation with 12 users depicts a 3D joint angle tracking accuracy of 9.07° (joint position accuracy of 6.55mm) with robustness to natural variation in sensor positions, wrist motion, etc, with low overhead in latency and power consumption on embedded platforms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common life-threatening clinical syndrome in hospitalized patients. Advances in machine learning has demonstrated success in AKI risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs). However, to prevent AKI, it is critical to identify clinically modifiable factors and understand their impact at different prevention windows. Method: We extracted 4129 clinical variables including demographics, social history, past diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, vitals from EHRs for a cohort of 144,084 eligible inpatient encounters. We developed a multi-view learning framework for XGBoost (MV-XGB) to enhance algorithm attention on modifiable factors. To study effects of modifiable factors at different time points, we built AKI prediction models at 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours before AKI onset. To characterize the temporal changes in effect of modifiable factors on AKI, we derived two indicators, inter-class score-difference and exposed-score-difference, based on SHAP values to compare effects of modifiable factors in different windows. Result: MV-XGB effectively increased attention on modifiable factors (explained 92.4%-94.1% inter-class score-difference, i.e., predictive difference between AKI and non-AKI samples) while maintaining good predictive performance (AUROCs were 0.854, 0.798, 0.765 in models for 24–48-72 h AKI prediction respectively). We observed that 62% of predicted odds-ratio difference between AKI and non-AKI patients in 24 h can be explained by factors occurring between 24 and 72 h. Among the important modifiable factors, electrolyte balance explained 38.3% of the inter-class score difference increase between 24 h and 72 h, followed by high-risk medications (13.7%), care strategy (12.1%), blood pressure (10%), infection (7.8%), and anemia (5.4%). Effects of cardiac surgery or condition, respiratory ventilation, and anemia remained important longer than 72 h. Conclusion: Better understanding of the clinically modifiable factors is important to AKI prevention. The proposed multi-view learning approach improved the identification of modifiable factors of AKI and allowed characterization of the temporal dynamics of their potential benefit in intervention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the more popular cricket world tournaments, and its financial is increasing each season, its viewership has increased markedly and the betting market for IPL is growing significantly every year. With cricket being a very dynamic game, bettors and bookies are incentivised to bet on the match results because it is a game that changes ball-by-ball. This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Performing analytics tasks over large-scale video datasets is increasingly common in a wide range of applications, from traffic planning to sports analytics. These tasks generally involve object detection and tracking operations that require pre-processing the video through expensive machine learning models. To address this cost, several video query optimizers have recently been proposed. Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies. We compare OTIF against three recent video query optimizers, as well as several general-purpose object detection and tracking techniques, and find that, across multiple datasets, OTIF provides a 6x to 25x average reduction in the overall cost to execute five queries over the same video. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Choosing the right defensive corner-strategy is a crucial task for each coach in professional football (soccer). Although corners are repeatable and static situations, due to their low conversion rates, several studies in literature failed to find useable insights about the efficiency of various corner strategies. Our work aims to fill this gap. We hand-label the role of each defensive player from 213 corners in 33 matches, where we then employ an augmentation strategy to increase the number of data points. By combining a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory neural network, we are able to detect the defensive strategy of each player based on positional data. We identify which of seven well-established roles a defensive player conducted (player-marking, zonal-marking, placed for counterattack, back-space, short defender, near-post, and far-post). The model achieves an overall weighted accuracy of 89.3%, and in the case of player-marking, we are able to accurately detect which offensive player the defender is marking 80.8% of the time. The performance of the model is evaluated against a rule-based baseline model, as well as by an inter-labeller accuracy. We demonstrate that rules can also be used to support the labelling process and serve as a baseline for weak supervision approaches. We show three concrete use-cases on how this approach can support a more informed and fact-based decision making process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the process of drug discovery, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is still an active research field and is one of the most common and important issues in toxicity evaluation research. It directly leads to the high wear attrition of the drug. At present, there are a variety of computer algorithms based on molecular representations to predict DILI. It is found that a single molecular representation method is insufficient to complete the task of toxicity prediction, and multiple molecular fingerprint fusion methods have been used as model input. In order to solve the problem of high dimensional and unbalanced DILI prediction data, this paper integrates existing datasets and designs a new algorithm framework, Rotation-Ensemble-GA (R-E-GA). The main idea is to find a feature subset with better predictive performance after rotating the fusion vector of high-dimensional molecular representation in the feature space. Then, an Adaboost-type ensemble learning method is integrated into R-E-GA to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the performance of R-E-GA is better than other state-of-art algorithms including ensemble learning-based and graph neural network-based methods. Through five-fold cross-validation, the R-E-GA obtains an ACC of 0.77, an F1 score of 0.769, and an AUC of 0.842. The DILI data and source code for R-E-GA in this study are available in supplements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Even though practicing sports has great health benefits, it also entails a risk of developing overuse injuries, which can elicit a negative impact on physical, mental, and financial health. Being able to predict the risk of an overuse injury arising is of widespread interest because this may play a vital role in preventing its occurrence. In this paper, we present a machine learning model trained to predict the occurrence of a lower-limb overuse injury (LLOI). This model was trained and evaluated using data from a three-dimensional accelerometer on the lower back, collected during a Cooper test performed by 161 first-year undergraduate students of a movement science program. In this study, gender-specific models performed better than mixed-gender models. The estimated area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of the best-performing male-and female-specific models, trained according to the presented approach, was, respectively, 0.615 and 0.645. In addition, the best-performing models were achieved by combining statistical and sports-specific features. Overall, the results demonstrated that a machine learning injury prediction model is a promising, yet challenging approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics has benefited immensely from the growth and popularity of Machine Learning algorithms. Machine Learning and Data Mining advances have enabled sports analysts to evaluate a player's performance more effectively. A review of existing literature on player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) Cricket. We propose a Deep Player Performance Index (DPPI) to evaluate a T20 Cricket player based on batting and bowling strengths. DPPI captures a player's current form and role in the team. DPPI serves a dual purpose. First, it enables sports fans and researchers to compare players playing a similar role in different teams. Second, the aggregated DPPI values of players playing at different positions in a team give the approximate team strength. To build DPPI, we first modify the existing Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) player performance evaluation guidelines. We then use the modified guidelines in the context of T20 Cricket. We propose DPPI based on K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithm and compare our results with the existing player performance evaluation indexes for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 season. Our empirical results show that DPPI captures a player's batting and bowling strength better than other indexes. Thus, DPPI serves as a helpful index for fantasy Cricket users, Cricket fans, coaches, and managers to gain better insights into a player's performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Drug-induced Liver Injury (DILI) is a leading cause of drug failure, account-ing for nearly 20% of drug withdrawal. Thus, there has been a great demand for in silico DILI prediction models for successful drug discovery. To date, various models have been developed for DILI pre-diction; however, building an accurate model for practical use in drug discovery remains challenging. Methods: We constructed an ensemble model composed of three high-performance DILI prediction models to utilize the unique advantage of each machine learning algorithm. Results: The ensemble model exhibited high predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.88, sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.77, F1-score of 0.82, and accuracy of 0.80. When a test dataset collected from the literature was used to compare the performance of our model with publicly available DILI prediction models, our model achieved an accuracy of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.72, and F1-score of 0.79, which were higher than those of the other DILI prediction models. As many pub-lished DILI prediction models are not available for public access, which hinders in silico drug discov-ery, we made our DILI prediction model publicly accessible (http://ssbio.cau.ac.kr/software/dili/). Conclusion: We expect that our ensemble model may facilitate advancements in drug discovery by providing a highly predictive model and reducing the drug withdrawal rate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Methods: Here we combined health data acquired from wellness and fitness surveys, reaction times from mobile Erikson flanker test, and other biometric information to provide a platform for monitoring a large number of athletes for the risk of future musculoskeletal injury. Our study participants were a cohort of 74 college football players. Injuries were documented throughout a 4-week pre-season practice period and the 12-game regular season. We tested three different predictive algorithms to classify the likelihood of the occurrence of a musculoskeletal injury. Results: The XGBoost model showed the highest overall accuracy with 91.9%. The CHAID and MLP models exhibited accuracies of 74.3% and 75.7%, respectively. The MLP model showed the highest accuracy in the training dataset with 80% correct. Conclusion: The predictive models combined with a mobile platform for data collection have great potential to monitor a large group of athletes and identify the at-risk population. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: AKI is a serious complication characterized by poor short-and long-Term outcomes in the intensive care unit. An increase in serum creatinine leads to impairment in renal function of the kidney and significantly increases the mortality rate. Early detection of AKI could lead to preventive interventions, therefore machine learning systems can detect AKI before its symptoms and consequences appear. Methods: We used a machine learning technique like boosted ensembles of decision trees along with novel kidney biomarkers to predict AKI using retrospective data extracted from the MIMIC-III dataset. Results: Our proposed algorithm achieved high AUROC for diagnosing and predicting AKI with novel kidney biomarkers. For AKI prediction at the point of onset, the algorithm achieved an AUROC of 0.890 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.878). Also, our proposed algorithm obtained an AUROC of 0.82 (95 percent CI, 0.792-0.809) for predictions made 12-hours before onset and an AUROC of 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.785-0.804) for 24-hours predictions. Conclusion: The findings suggest that a machine learning-based AKI prediction tool with biomarkers could provide key prognostic skills for predicting which patients are at risk of AKI, eventually enabling physicians to intercede before kidney injuries occur. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Basketball is a prominent team sport played on a rectangular court between two teams of five players each. The goal is to shoot the ball through the defender's hoop, which is high on a backboard at each end of the court, while stopping the other team from shooting through its own hoop. Predicting how sports will turn out is an interesting sports analytics problem because it gives valuable data for running the sports market. In this work, data from NBA (National Basketball Association) basketball teams is analyzed, and a machine learning model is made that uses advanced statistical measures and performance data to evaluate and predict the winning percentage of different teams. Voting Regression is used to put together algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Gaussian Regression, and Gradient Boosting into a single unit that can predict a team's win percentage over the course of a season with 93.3% accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics have become an important part in the improvement of athlete performances in the last decade. Badminton is one such sport where sports analytics can prove beneficial for its athletes. By incorporating data analysis and machine learning techniques, we can learn more about an athlete's performance and profile them via their results in official badminton matches, and coaches as well as athletes may use the results to identify possible improvements for the athlete. This work presents a model to profile the performances of two Indonesian badminton athletes through machine learning using official score data of matches played from 2018 to 2021. We have built a model that performs athlete profiling through regression, classification, and clustering methods. Our result shows that Random Forest outperformed SVM method on regression and the two methods performed similarly on classification, while K-means and hierarchical clustering models displayed similar results in data clustering. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Doing weightlifting training at home has become more popular during the pandemic. Unfortunately, exercising without professional help can lead to dangerous injuries such as muscle tearing. It is possible to create a smart system with machine learning to overcome muscle injuries and suggest an appropriate training program. The use of suitable algorithms enables us to develop programs that can perform predictions based on sEMG (Surface Electromyography) signals. In this study, sEMG signals are collected from the skin surface and features are extracted to be used in deep learning networks. A wearable hardware collects sEMG signals and transfers them to our mobile application via Bluetooth. The mobile application transfers data to the cloud to make predictions based on sEMG signals. We developed MuscleNET for training monitoring, injury prediction/detection, and training quality prediction. Initial measurements indicate that MuscleNET can be used effectively for training quality prediction and real time training monitoring. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to predict the risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in intensive care units (ICUs) using machine learning techniques and statistical approaches. The data used in the study are derived from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III, which is a freely accessible database of de-identified ICU-related data. The paper focuses on two different phases. The first one consists of a scrupulous phase of extraction and transformation of MIMIC data to retrieve all the criteria specified in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline definition of AKI. The main features included are demographics, medications, comorbidities, charted vital signs, and laboratory events. In the second phase, we used several different techniques already used to predict AKI, and we also added a complex temporal feature, called Trend-Event Feature (TE-F). The prediction was performed using a rolling observational window design that includes the data collection window (length: 1 to 6 days) and the prediction window (7 days). The Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) method was used, with different groups of features, to predict the risk of AKI. To evaluate the GBDT performances, we used the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), Recall, Precision, and F-score measures. We observed that lab parameters contribute the most to the prediction of the AKI risk. Moreover, adding TE-Fs to different groups of features leads to better performance results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Obtaining player identities is essential for analyzing the game and is used in downstream tasks such as game event recognition. Transformers are the existing standard in natural language processing (NLP) and are swiftly gaining traction in computer vision. Motivated by the increasing success of transformers in computer vision, we introduce a transformer network for recognizing players through their jersey numbers in broadcast National Hockey League (NHL) videos. The transformer takes temporal sequences of player frames (called player tracklets) as input and outputs the probabilities of jersey numbers present in the frames. The proposed network performs better than the previous benchmark on the same dataset. We implement a weakly-supervised training approach by generating approximate frame-level labels for jersey number presence and use the frame-level labels for faster training. We also utilize player shifts available in the NHL play-by-play data by reading the game time using optical character recognition (OCR) to get the players on the ice rink at a certain game time. Using player-shifts improved the player identification accuracy by 6%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In general, a football team player selection is a decision made by the club based on the best available information. Club managers and scouts travel to different countries to watch matches and hire the best talent that can help their club to perform better. But for the lower leagues, it becomes difficult to hire the same talents because of strict budget. Here we devise a method so that we can leverage the undervalued players to get selected by the clubs. Clearly the benefit will be in two fold. First, the smaller clubs can get better players at an affordable cost. Second, the bigger clubs can get same performance players at a lower price helping them in cost cutting. We employ novelty detection methods to find out the undervalued players from our data and investigate our method by using five machine learning models. For performance evaluation, the five machine learning models used are support vector machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression and XGBoost. Here XGboost performed best both for 10 fold cross-validation and external testing with a RMSE of 0.0122 and 0.0107 respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite a vast application of temporal point processes in infectious disease diffusion forecasting, ecommerce, traffic prediction, preventive maintenance, etc, there is no significant development in improving the simulation and prediction of temporal point processes in real-world environments. With this problem at hand, we propose a novel methodology for learning temporal point processes based on one-dimensional numerical integration techniques. These techniques are used for linearising the negative maximum likelihood (neML) function and enabling backpropagation of the neML derivatives. Our approach is tested on two real-life datasets. Firstly, on high frequency point process data, (prediction of highway traffic) and secondly, on a very low frequency point processes dataset, (prediction of ski injuries in ski resorts). Four different point process baseline models were compared: second-order Polynomial inhomogeneous process, Hawkes process with exponential kernel, Gaussian process, and Poisson process. The results show the ability of the proposed methodology to generalize on different datasets and illustrate how different numerical integration techniques and mathematical models influence the quality of the obtained models. The presented methodology is not limited to these datasets and can be further used to optimize and predict other processes that are based on temporal point processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There has been an explosion of data collected about sports. Because such data is extremely rich and complicated, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Unfortunately, how to evaluate the use of machine learning in the context of sports remains extremely challenging. On the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the developed indicators themselves, where one is confronted by a lack of labels and small sample sizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate the models themselves, which is complicated by the noisy and non-stationary nature of sports data. In this paper, we highlight the inherent evaluation challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for evaluating both indicators and models. In particular, we highlight how reasoning techniques, such as verification can be used to aid in the evaluation of learned models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the allocation and utilization efficiency improvement of rural physical education resources are an important element of rural physical education construction. With the mature development of artificial intelligence technology, it has great potential for application in the field of cultural education. Artificial intelligence technology has the advantages of ease of use, strong self-adaptation, and excellent generalization ability, and it is selected for data processing in this paper. Using artificial intelligence technology, the study of sports informatization to help rural sports development and rational utilization of resources can help rural sports education development, rural sports industry prosperity, rural sports talent revitalization, rural sports governance system improvement, and governance capacity enhancement.

Then, a study was carried out on the occurrences of physical injury risks through visual sensing techniques, and an investigation was conducted into the characteristics of physical injury risks in colleges. Next, the student's body shape and physical characteristics are computed using visual sensing techniques, and the risk of sports injuries is evaluated. The results show that the proposed image recognition and computation methods can accurately identify the sports injuries of college students. Furthermore, it can effectively analyze the factors affecting the risk of sports injuries, and the error of the proposed technique remains between -3 and 2.

	abstract = {We investigated the impact of sleep and training load of Division-1 women's basketball players on their game performance and injury prediction using machine learning algorithms. The data was collected during a pandemic-condensed season with unpredictable interruptions to the games and athletic training schedules. We collected data from sleep monitoring devices, training data from coaches, injury reports from medical staff, and weekly survey data from athletes for 22 weeks. With proper data imputation, interpretable feature set, data balancing, and classifiers, we showed that we could predict game performance and injuries with more than 90% accuracy. More importantly, our F1 and F2 scores of 0.94 and 0.83 for game performance and injuries, respectively, show that we can use the prediction for informative analysis in the future for coaches to make insightful decisions. Our data analysis also showed that collegiate athletes sleep less than the recommended hours (6-7 instead of 8 hours). This coupled with a long hiatus in games and training increases the risk of injury. Varied training and higher heart rate variability (due to better quality sleep) indicated a better performance, while athletes with poor sleep patterns, were more prone to injuries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Throwing sports remain a popular pastime and frequent source of musculoskeletal injuries, particularly those involving the shoulder and elbow. Biomechanical analyses of throwing athletes have identified pathomechanic factors that predispose throwers to injury or poor performance. These factors, or key performance indicators, are an ongoing topic of research, with the goals of improved injury prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation. Important key performance indicators in the literature to date include shoulder and elbow torque, shoulder rotation, kinetic chain function (as measured by trunk rotation timing and hip-shoulder separation), and lower-extremity mechanics (including stride characteristics). The current gold standard for biomechanical analysis of the throwing athlete involves marker-based 3-dimensional) video motion capture. Emerging technologies such as marker-less motion capture, wearable technology, and machine learning have the potential to further refine our understanding. This review will discuss the biomechanics of throwing, with particular attention to baseball pitching, while also delineating methods of modern throwing analysis, implications for clinical orthopaedic practice, and future areas of research interest.

	abstract = {Passes are by far football’s (soccer) most frequent event, yet surprisingly little meaningful research has been devoted to quantify them. With the increase in availability of so-called positional data, describing the positioning of players and ball at every moment of the game, our work aims to determine the difficulty of every pass by calculating its success probability based on its surrounding circumstances. As most experts will agree, not all passes are of equal difficulty, however, most traditional metrics count them as such. With our work we can quantify how well players can execute passes, assess their risk profile, and even compute completion probabilities for hypothetical passes by combining physical and machine learning models. Our model uses the first 0.4 seconds of a ball trajectory and the movement vectors of all players to predict the intended target of a pass with an accuracy of 93.0 % for successful and 72.0 % for unsuccessful passes much higher than any previously published work. Our extreme gradient boosting model can then quantify the likelihood of a successful pass completion towards the identified target with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.4 %. Finally, we discuss several potential applications, like player scouting or evaluating pass decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Visualizing data in sports videos is gaining traction in sports analytics, given its ability to communicate insights and explicate player strategies engagingly. However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level (what the constituents are) and clip-level (how those constituents are organized). We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the way in which we consume and analyse sports. The role of AI in improving decision-making and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and in sport research.

Early prediction of DILI can bring a significant reduction in the cost of clinical trials. In this work we examined whether occurrence of DILI can be predicted using gene expression profile in cancer cell lines and chemical properties of drugs. Methods: We used gene expression profiles from 13 human cell lines, as well as molecular properties of drugs to build Machine Learning models of DILI. To this end, we have used a robust cross-validated protocol based on feature selection and Random Forest algorithm. In this protocol we first identify the most informative variables and then use them to build predictive models. The models are first built using data from single cell lines, and chemical properties. Then they are integrated using Super Learner method with several underlying methods for integration. The entire modelling process is performed using nested cross-validation. Results: We have obtained weakly predictive ML models when using either molecular descriptors, or some individual cell lines (AUC ∈(0.55−0.61)). Models obtained with the Super Learner approach have a significantly improved accuracy (AUC=0.73), which allows to divide substances in two categories: low-risk and high-risk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental topics in sports analytics is the science of success, i.e., the study of the correlation between players’ performances and their success. This is a very challenging task especially in the case of team sports, among which football is a prominent example. This paper is concerned with uncovering a dangerous bias that is present in most of the approaches proposed in the literature that apply statistical techniques or machine learning models to study the correlation between team performances and match outcome. In particular, we find out that players’ behavior on a time interval is more and more correlated with the match outcome as the 90 minutes elapse. As an extreme example, we show that we can predict the output of a match with high confidence simply by looking at the last 15 minutes of the game. We call this effect elapsing-time bias. We conduct a quantitative analysis that proves the existence of this phenomenon and shows its consequences. We then propose a novel way to address the problem. Namely, we design a new machine learning task that is not affected by elapsing-time bias. All the experiments are conducted on a large corpus of finely annotated football matches of European leagues. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Staying injury free is a major factor for success in sports. Although injuries are difficult to forecast, novel technologies and data-science applications could provide important insights. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs. Methods: Prediction of injuries was evaluated on a new data set of 74 high-level middle- and long-distance runners, over a period of 7 years. Two analytic approaches were applied. First, the training load from the previous 7 days was expressed as a time series, with each day’s training being described by 10 features. These features were a combination of objective data from a global positioning system watch (eg, duration, distance), together with subjective data about the exertion and success of the training. Second, a training week was summarized by 22 aggregate features, and a time window of 3 weeks before the injury was considered. Results: A predictive system based on bagged XGBoost machine-learning models resulted in receiver operating characteristic curves with average areas under the curves of 0.724 and 0.678 for the day and week approaches, respectively. The results of the day approach especially reflect a reasonably high probability that our system makes correct injury predictions. Conclusions: Our machine-learning-based approach predicts a sizable portion of the injuries, in particular when the model is based on training-load data in the days preceding an injury. Overall, these results demonstrate the possible merits of using machine learning to predict injuries and tailor training programs for athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Investments in electricity will continue to increase, leading to construction project complexities, which undoubtedly contribute to injuries and associated effects.

In this study, we develop and compare state-of-the-art ML algorithms (deep learning and boosted trees) with other conventional methods to overcome this problem by analyzing incident cases obtained from a leading UK power infrastructure company. The predictive performance of the developed models was benchmarked using a statistical comparison between observations and predicted values. Results showed that the implementation of deep feedforward neural networks achieved the best predictions (accuracy = 0.967 and Cohen Kappa measure = 0.964). Furthermore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of input parameters and data sizes on the modes’ behavior.

A robust binary decision (Yes/No) about the requirement of any irreversible safety action such as the deployment of airbags in the pre-crash phase is a big step. In this work, we investigate different machine learning approaches for determining the severity of occupant injury in two classes: Safe Zone and Injury Zone. One of the essential outcomes of this paper is the selection of the input features through feature engineering. Five machine learning models are investigated and compared based on different evaluation criteria to find the best classification model for the application. XGBoost, Catboost, Random Forest, Kernel SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were trained on data collected through FEM simulations. XGBoost was found to be the best performing model. If the predicted severity lies in the Injury Zone during pre-crash, airbag activation is required. Hence, this prediction can be used in pre-crash for steering an inevitable crash in a crash with low severity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present an interpretable machine learning algorithm called 'eARDS' for predicting ARDS in an ICU population comprising COVID-19 patients, up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin clinical criteria. The analysis was conducted on data collected from the Intensive care units (ICU) at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN and the Cerner® Health Facts Deidentified Database, a multisite COVID-19 EMR database. The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75-0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085-0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81-0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO2), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O2 flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18-40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92-0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81-0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups. The eARDS system demonstrated robust performance for predicting COVID19 patients who developed ARDS at least 12-hours before the Berlin clinical criteria, across two independent health systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Detecting counterpressing is an important task for any professional match-analyst in football (soccer), but is being done exclusively manually by observing video footage. The purpose of this paper is not only to automatically identify this strategy, but also to derive metrics that support coaches with the analysis of transition situations. Additionally, we want to infer objective influence factors for its success and assess the validity of peer-created rules of thumb established in by practitioners. Based on a combination of positional and event data we detect counterpressing situations as a supervised machine learning task. Together, with professional match-analysis experts we discussed and consolidated a consistent definition, extracted 134 features and manually labeled more than 20, 000 defensive transition situations from 97 professional football matches. The extreme gradient boosting model—with an area under the curve of 87.4 % on the labeled test data—enabled us to judge how quickly teams can win the ball back with counterpressing strategies, how many shots they create or allow immediately afterwards and to determine what the most important success drivers are. We applied this automatic detection on all matches from six full seasons of the German Bundesliga and quantified the defensive and offensive consequences when applying counterpressing for each team. Automating the task saves analysts a tremendous amount of time, standardizes the otherwise subjective task, and allows to identify trends within larger data-sets. We present an effective way of how the detection and the lessons learned from this investigation are integrated effectively into common match-analysis processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectively quantifying the value of player actions in football (soccer) is a challenging problem. To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Theoretical basis: Resource-based view (RBV) theory (Barney, 1991; Barney and Mackey, 2016; Nagano, 2020) states that a firm’s tangible and intangible resources can represent a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), a long-term competitive advantage that is extremely difficult to duplicate by another firm, when it meets four criteria (i.e. not imitable, are rare, valuable and not substitutable). In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies…. and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology: This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis: MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation. Complexity academic level: The case is written and designed for a graduate-level (MBA) class or an upper-level undergraduate class in areas such as contemporary issues in management, human resource management, talent management, strategic management, sports management and sports marketing. The case is suitable for courses that discuss strategy, talent management, human resource management and brand strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of machine learning on spatio-temporal datasets has generated significant interest in a range of applications, including vehicular traffic modelling and urban planning. One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24Â° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33Â° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A diverse dataset containing video data of 11 basic strokes obtained from 14 professional table tennis players, summing up to a total of 22111 videos has been collected using the proposed setup. The temporal convolutional neural network model developed using 2D pose estimation performs multiclass classification of these 11 table tennis strokes with a validation accuracy of 99.37%. Moreover, the neural network generalizes well over the data of a player excluded from the training and validation dataset, classifying the fresh strokes with an overall best accuracy of 98.72%. Various model architectures using machine learning and deep learning based approaches have been trained for stroke recognition and their performances have been compared and benchmarked. Inferences such as performance monitoring and stroke comparison of the players using the model have been discussed.

The large number of indicators in AKI patients makes it difficult for clinicians to quickly and accurately determine the patient's condition. This study used machine learning methods to filter key indicators and use key indicator data to achieve advance prediction of AKI so that a small number of indicators could be measured to reliably predict AKI and provide auxiliary decision support for clinical staff. Sequential forward selection based on feature importance calculated by XGBoost was used to screen out 17 key indicators. Three machine learning algorithms were used to make predictions, namely, logistic regression (LR), decision tree, and XGBoost. To verify the validity of the method, data were extracted from the MIMIC III database and the eICU-CRD database for 1,009 and 1,327 AKI patients, respectively. The MIMIC III database was used for internal validation, and the eICU-CRD database was used for external validation. For all three machine learning algorithms, the prediction performance from using only the key indicator dataset was very close to that from using the full dataset. The XGBoost algorithm performed the best, and LR was the next best. The decision tree performed the worst. The key indicator screening method proposed in this study can achieve a good predictive performance while streamlining the number of indicators. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Human-activity recognition has gained significant attention recently within the computer vision and machine learning community, due to its applications in diverse fields such as health, entertainment, visual surveillance and sports analytics. An important sub-category of human-activity recognition is group activity recognition (GAR) where a group of individuals is involved in an activity. The main challenge in such recognition tasks is to learn the relationship between a group of individuals in a scene and its evolution over time. Recently, many techniques based on deep networks and graphical models have been proposed for group activity recognition. In this paper, we critically analyze the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for group activity recognition. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the SOTA techniques conducted in the field of group activity recognition and divide the existing literature into different subcategories. We also identify the available datasets and the existing research challenges for GAR. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of exciting applications in augmented reality, sports analytics, rehabilitation-healthcare etc. While finger motion tracking with cameras is very mature, largely due to availability of massive training datasets, there is a dearth of training data for developing robust machine learning (ML) models for wearable IoT devices with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. Towards addressing this problem, this paper presents ZeroNet, a system that shows the feasibility of developing ML models for IMU sensors with zero training overhead. ZeroNet harvests training data from publicly available videos for performing inferences on IMU. The difference in data among video and IMU domains introduces a number of challenges due to differences in sensor-camera coordinate systems, body sizes of users, speed/orientation changes during gesturing, sensor position variations etc. ZeroNet addresses these challenges by systematically extracting motion data from videos and transforming them into acceleration and orientation information measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, data-augmentation techniques are exploited that create synthetic variations in the harvested training data to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the ML models to user diversity. Evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 82.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 94.8% for recognition of 50 finger gestures thus indicating promise. While we have only scratched the surface, we outline a number of interesting possibilities for extending this work in the cross-disciplinary areas of computer vision, machine learning, and wearable IoT for enabling novel applications in finger motion tracking. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized patients and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Although early prediction of AKI has the potential to reduce adverse patient outcomes, it remains a difficult condition to predict and diagnose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict for AKI as defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 or 3 up to 48 hours in advance of onset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and patient electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: A CNN prediction system was developed to use EHR data gathered during patients’ stays to predict AKI up to 48 hours before onset. A total of 12,347 patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. An XGBoost AKI prediction model and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system were used as comparators. The outcome was AKI onset. The model was trained on routinely collected patient EHR data. Measurements included area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, positive predictive value (PPV), and a battery of additional performance metrics for advance prediction of AKI onset. Results: On a hold-out test set, the algorithm attained an AUROC of 0.86 and PPV of 0.24, relative to a cohort AKI prevalence of 7.62%, for long-horizon AKI prediction at a 48-hour window before onset. Conclusion: A CNN machine learning-based AKI prediction model outperforms XGBoost and the SOFA scoring system, revealing superior performance in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset, without reliance on serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The application of machine learning. J Strength Cond Res 35(4): 910-919, 2021-This study used machine learning (ML) to predict injuries among adolescents by functional movement testing. This research is a part of the CRO-PALS study conducted in a representative sample of adolescents and analyses for this study are based on nonathletic (n = 364) and athletic (n = 192) subgroups of the cohort (16-17 years). Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), body fatness, moderate-To-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), training hours per week, Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and socioeconomic status were assessed at baseline. A year later, data on injury occurrence were collected. The optimal cut-point of the total FMS score for predicting injury was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve. These predictors were included in ML analyses with calculated metrics: Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with associated criterium of total FMS score >12 showed AUC of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.48-0.59) and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.47-0.63), for the nonathletic and athletic youth, respectively. However, in the nonathletic subgroup, ML showed that the Naïve Bayes exhibited highest AUC (0.58), whereas in the athletic group, logistic regression was demonstrated as the model with the best predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.62). In both subgroups, with given predictors: sex, age, BMI, body fat percentage, MVPA, training hours per week, socioeconomic status, and total FMS score, ML can give a more accurate prediction then FMS alone. Results indicate that nonathletic boys who have lower-body fat could be more prone to suffer from injury incidence, whereas among athletic subjects, boys who spend more time training are at a higher risk of being injured. Conclusively, total FMS cut-off scores for each subgroup did not successfully discriminate those who suffered from those who did not suffer from injury, and, therefore, our research does not support FMS as an injury prediction tool. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the low scoring nature of football (soccer), shots are often used as a proxy to evaluate team and player performances. However, not all shots are created equally and their quality differs significantly depending on the situation. The aim of this study is to objectively quantify the quality of any given shot by introducing a so-called expected goals (xG) model. This model is validated statistically and with professional match analysts. The best performing model uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm and is based on hand-crafted features from synchronized positional and event data of 105, 627 shots in the German Bundesliga. With a ranked probability score (RPS) of 0.197, it is more accurate than any previously published expected goals model. This approach allows us to assess team and player performances far more accurately than is possible with traditional metrics by focusing on process rather than results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Poor predictive ability of urine output (UOP) and creatinine contribute to the delayed recognition of AKI. Objective.—To determine the impact of point-of-care (POC) AKI biomarker enhanced by machine learning (ML) algorithms in burn-injured and trauma patients. Design.—We conducted a 2-phased study to develop and validate a novel POC device for measuring neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine from blood samples. In phase I, 40 remnant plasma samples were used to evaluate the analytic performance of the POC device. Next, phase II enrolled 125 adults with either burns that were 20% or greater of total body surface area or nonburn trauma with suspicion of AKI for clinical validation. We applied an automated ML approach to develop models predicting AKI, using a combination of NGAL, creatinine, and/or UOP as features. Results.—Point-of-care NGAL (mean [SD] bias: 9.8 [38.5] ng/mL, P ¼ .10) and creatinine results (mean [SD] bias: 0.28 [0.30] mg/dL, P ¼ .18) were comparable to the reference method. NGAL was an independent predictor of AKI (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.08–5.20; P ¼ .01). The optimal ML model achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96%, 92.3%, and 97.7%, respectively, with NGAL, creatinine, and UOP as features. Area under the receiver operator curve was 0.96. Conclusions.—Point-of-care NGAL testing is feasible and produces results comparable to reference methods. Machine learning enhanced the predictive performance of AKI biomarkers including NGAL and was superior to the current techniques. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Hiring employees and contract renewals are instances of managerial decision-making problems that can incur high financial costs and long-term impacts on organizational performance. The primary goal of this study is to identify the Major League Baseball (MLB) free agents who are likely to receive a contract. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the design science research paradigm and the cognitive analytics management (CAM) theory to develop the research framework. A dataset on MLB's free agents between 2013 and 2017 was collected. A decision support tool was built using artificial neural networks. Findings: There are clear links between a player's statistical performance and the decision of the player to sign a new offered contract. “Age,” “Wins above Replacement” and “the team on which a player last played” are the most significant factors in determining if a player signs a new contract. Originality/value: This paper applied analytical modeling to personnel decision-making using the design science paradigm and guided by CAM as the kernel theory. The study employed machine learning techniques, producing a model that predicts the probability of free agents signing a new contract. Also, a web-based tool was developed to help decision-makers in baseball front offices so they can determine which available free agents to offer contracts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequently reported single cause of safety-related withdrawal of marketed drugs. It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To test whether positions could be identified from the statistical performance of the players, the dimensionality reduction techniques were used. To better understand the differences between the player positions, the most discriminatory variables for each group were obtained as a set of rules discovered by RIPPER, a machine learning algorithm. From the combination of both techniques, we obtained useful conclusions to enhance the performance of players and to identify positions on the field.

This way the coach can experiment with several planned alternatives to figure out the best way for preparing the athlete for a race. We conduct multiple prediction models through an extensive analysis of a real dataset collected recently about the performance of professional riders with varying physiologies and temporal performance peaks. We show that the application of the hybrid model using XGBoost and CatBoost has clear advantages. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of our general model can be further increased by filtering according to the mountain stages.

	abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI), a common disease in the intensive care unit(ICU), which is one of the most common critical diseases, has a great impact on patients' life safety and length of stay. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. In the past, traditional machine learning methods such as logistic regression and XGBoost mainly used laboratory data and the statistical features of vital signs data to predict the occurrence of AKI. These methods have achieved good predictive performance, but the statistical values obviously cannot represent all the information of vital signs data. Therefore, a TCN-based model is proposed in this paper. The patient's vital signs data in the ICU, laboratory examination data, and statistical features of monitoring data are fused as input to the model. Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced into our model to discover more useful temporal features by calculating the independence between statistics and monitoring data. In addition, we also explore the impact of changes in vital signs on the occurrence of AKI based on complete vital signs data. Numerical experiments were carried out on the public data set MIMIC-III. Compared with the four baseline models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Long-Short Term Memory Network, and XGBoost), our model showed excellent performance. In the ablation experiment, the effectiveness of HSIC in mining temporal features is proven. Moreover, the proposed model can effectively discover important changes in monitoring data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The process of modelling individual player performance using machine learning is a mature task in sports analytics. The most significant challenges in machine learning include class imbalance and high dimensionality problems. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and observed that both the issues have been studied independently. We found that feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of relevant features, while data sampling seeks to make the data more balanced by adding or removing instances. We also found out that efforts have been taken for studying the effect of the joint use of feature selection and balancing techniques. However, the prioritization of the feature selection and sampling is still difficult, and the relationship between them remains unclear. This paper presents a large-scale comparison of characterizing football players into nine positions by using FIFA video game data, whereas most of the previous studies in this field have focused on characterizing players into only three classes according to their positions. The proposed methodology for the study consists of three main steps. In the first step, the sampling technique is applied to deal with class imbalance, while the second step encompasses the feature selection technique, which deals with the high dimensionality problem. The third step combines feature selection and data sampling to deal with both the issues. We made the comparisons based on nine feature selection algorithms and three balancing techniques, and then we evaluated their performance using the random forest classifier. We found that 1) feature selection techniques did not improve the accuracy of the baseline model, 2) balancing techniques improved the accuracy compared to the baseline, and 3) the results showed superiority of the proposed methodology, involving the joint application of resampling and feature selection with data balanced by the random oversampling (ROS) method and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), compared to the results obtained only through the use of a single technique and from the original imbalanced training set. Overall, the proposed methodology improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the methodology provided a significant decrease in the number of features, from 29 to 10 features on average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Based on this, this article builds a sports injury prediction model under artificial intelligence and big data monitoring to accurately predict the injuries suffered by athletes, provide help to reduce athletes' injuries during training, and promote the development of dragon boat sports. This article selects 20 members of a dragon boat team from a university and randomly divides them into a control group (supplement of equal amounts of whey protein), a normal group, an ESM low-dose group (26 mg/kg bw/d), and an ESM high-dose group (52 mg/kg bw/d), with 5 people in each group. The subjects were subjected to downhill exercise and immune stimulation experiments. Among them, the subjects in the control group performed downhill exercise for 12 hours, and they were tested for lactic acid (LAC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, malondialdehyde (MDA), hemoglobin (Hb), blood creatinine (CRE), and other related physical and chemical indicators. The other three groups of subjects did not take low-dose and high-dose ESM for 7 consecutive days and were injected with lipopolysaccharide on the 8th day for immune stimulation and tested for interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10), and other related cytokines. The results show that oral egg membrane protein (ESM) can reduce subjects' serum LAC, LDH, urea, MDA, Hb, and CRE concentration. In addition, the ESM can reduce the expression of proinflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α, while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, which provides clinical data for the clinical use of ESM as a supplement for sports injury or for relieving arthritis symptoms. The study shows that egg membrane protein has a protective effect against sports injury and may be regulated by inflammatory factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden onset of kidney damage. Currently, there is no hybrid model predicting AKI that takes advantage of two types of data. In this research, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for AKI prediction was created using de-identified numeric patient data and ultrasound kidney images. Using data features including serum creatinine among others, two numeric models using MIMIC-III and paired hospital data were developed, and with the hospital ultrasounds, an image-only model was developed. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used, including VGG and Resnet, and they were made into a hybrid model by concatenating feature maps of both types of models to create a new input. The hybrid model successfully predicted AKI and the highest AUROC of the model was 0.953, the first time an AKI machine learning model surpassed an AUROC of 0.9. The model also achieved an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of 0.91. This model can be implemented into urgent clinical settings such as the ICU and aid doctors by assessing the risk of AKI shortly after the patient’s admission to the ICU. The implementation of this research has great potential to be applied to different medical predictive applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As the level of soccer in our country has improved rapidly, the level of skill has gradually improved, and the requirements for training of athletes have increased. Due to changes in athlete training methods, it has been decided that athletes must bear a great risk of sports injuries. Accurate prediction of injuries is very important for the development of youth soccer. Based on this, this paper proposes a text classification algorithm based on machine learning and builds a sports injury prediction model that can accurately predict athlete injuries, reduce athlete injuries during training, and be effective. We put forward various sports suitable for young athletes, and put forward some measures to prevent and alleviate athletes' injuries. This article selects 48 football players from a college of physical education of a university for testing. The athletes participating in the experiment use professional equipment to collect exercise volume and exercise load data, and real-time records of each athlete's physical fitness data within half a year, through the athlete's exercise volume, exercise load, body metabolism, and physical indicators to predict their sports injury. Experiments show that from the degree of injury, it can be seen that the severe injury is the least, with 5 cases of muscle injury, 2 cases of fascia ligament injury, and 1 case of joint injury. There were 25 cases of mild injuries, accounting for 41.0% of the total. This is because the athlete's sports injury prediction model has better prediction capabilities, allowing athlete coaches and therapists to optimize training courses, ultimately preventing injuries, improving training levels, and reducing rehabilitation costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The development of various artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks gained enormous attention in many areas, including injury prediction and health management via medical image analysis. The objective of the current study is to focus on a comprehensive high accurate prediction of ACL injury based on MRI medical images, and also demonstrate the ability of AI in practical and outline conceptual prediction and diagnosis frameworks for other types of knee injuries in the future. Our dataset comprised of knee MRI reports from Cho Ray Hospital, Vietnam which are composed of ACL and non-ACL injury patients. The MRI images were used as supporting data in the deep learning classification model with DenseNet-121 algorithm. The successful establishment of an ACL injury diagnosis model from MRI will pave the way for us to develop more diagnostic models of other injuries in the body as well as the prediction of bone diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The distributions of, and dose–response between, wellness and other load measures were also examined, offering insights into response patterns. Data (n= 14,109) were collated from an athlete management systems platform (Catapult Sports, Melbourne, Australia) and were split across three sports (cricket, rugby league and football) with data analysis conducted in R (Version 3.4.3). Wellness (sleep quality, readiness to train, general muscular soreness, fatigue, stress, mood, recovery rating and motivation) as the dependent variable, and sRPE, sRPE-TL and markers of external load (total distance and m.min<sup>−1</sup>) as independent variables were included for analysis. Classification and regression tree models showed high cross-validated error rates across all sports (i.e., > 0.89) and low model accuracy (i.e., < 5% of variance explained by each model) with similar results demonstrated using random forest models. These results suggest wellness items have limited predictive capacity in relation to internal and external load measures. This result was consistent despite varying statistical approaches (regression, classification and random forest models) and transformation of wellness scores. These findings indicate practitioners should exercise caution when interpreting and applying wellness responses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The commercialization of sport has encouraged players, coaches, and other concerns to use technology to be in better position than r their opponents. In the past, the focus was on improved training techniques for better physical performance. These days, sports analytics identify the patterns in the performance and highlight strengths and weaknesses of potential players. Sports analytics not only predict the performance of players in the near future but it also performs predictive modeling for a particular behavior of a player in the past. The impact of a smart player on the success of a team is always a big question mark before the start of a match. The fans always want to know performance analysis of these superstar players and they always are interested to get to know more about their favorite player and they always have high hopes from their favorite player. Machine learning (ML) based techniques help in predicting the performance of an individual player as well as for the whole team. The statistics are very vital and useful for management, fans, and expert analysis. In our proposed framework, the adaptive back propagation neural network (ABPNN) model is used for the prediction of a player's performance. The data is collected from football websites, and the results are stored in the cloud for fast fetching of data. They can be retrieved anywhere in the world through cloud storage. The results are computed with 94% accuracy and the performance of the smart player is formulated for the success of a team. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The main objective of this study is to accurately predict cardiovascular disease by comparison among different feature selection algorithms. This study has employed a two-stage feature sub-set retrieving technique to achieve this goal: we first considered three well-established feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded), and then, a feature sub-set was extracted using a Boolean process-based common “True” condition from these three algorithms. To justify the comparative accuracy and define the best predictive analytics, the well-known random forest, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost model have been considered. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been considered as the benchmark for further comparison with all features. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the XGBoost Classifier integrated with the wrapper methods offers precise prediction results for cardiovascular disease. The proposed approach can also be applied in other domains such as sports analytics, bio-informatics, and financial analysis in contrast with healthcare informatics. This empirical study’s novelty is that the common “True” condition–based feature selection and comparison technique is entirely a new phenomenon in medical informatics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports have evolved from the exposition of athletes' pure talent to an industry that generatesjobs and entertainment. In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of "SportsEd 3.5"for universities and collegiate athletic associations to develop an athlete information system for sports analytics. In addition, the framework aims to define the philosophy that will govern all the stakeholders in the utilization of an athlete's information for flexible decision-making. Players' dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports. Supervised algorithms were used to illustrate the value of data and machine learning models in athletic development programs.

Multimodal analysis can help find the most effective paddling techniques for training and competition based on individuals' abilities. We describe the characteristics of the output power of kayak athletes and Electromyogram (EMG) measurements collected from the most critical muscles, and the relationship between these modalities. We propose metrics (weighted arithmetic mean difference and variability of power output and stroke duration) suitable for discerning athletes based on how efficiently and correctly they perform particular training tasks. Additionally, the described methods (asymmetry, coactivation, muscle intensity-output power) help athletes and coaches in assessing their performance and compare it with others based on their EMG activities.

	abstract = {Background: Traumatic dental injuries are one of the most important problems with major physical, aesthetic, psychological, social, functional and therapeutic problems that adversely affect the quality of life of children and adolescents. Recently the development of methods based on machine learning algorithms has provided researchers with more powerful tools to more accurate prediction in different domains and evaluate the factors affecting different phenomena more reliably than traditional regression models. This study tries to investigate the performance of random forest (RF) in identifying factors associated with sports-related dental injuries. Also, the accuracy of the RF model for predicting sports-related dental injuries was compared with logistic regression model as traditional competitor. Methods: This cross-sectional study was applied to 356 athlete children aged 6 to 13-year-old in Hamadan, Iran. Random forest and logistic regression constructed by using sports-related dental injuries as response variables and age, sex, parent’s education, child’s birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, mouthguard use as input. A self-reported questionnaire was used to obtain information. Results: Fifty-five (15.4%) subjects had experienced a sports-related dental injury. The mean age of children with sports injuries was significantly higher than children without the experience of injury (p = 0.006). The prevalence of injury was significantly higher in boys (p = 0.008). Children with illiterate mothers are more likely to be injured than children with educated mothers (p = 0.045). Awareness of mouthguard and its use during exercise has a significant effect on reducing the prevalence of injury among users (p < 0.001). Random forest model has a higher prediction accuracy (89.3%) for predicting sports-related dental injuries compared to the logistic regression (84.2%). The results of the relative importance of variables, based on RF showed, mouthguard use, and mouthguard awareness has more contributed importance in dental sport-related injuries’ prediction. Subsequently, the importance of sex and age is in the next position. Conclusions: Using predictive models such as RF challenges existing inaccurate predictions due to high complexity and interactions between variables would be minimized. This helps to achieve more accurate identification of factors in sport-related dental injury among the general population of children. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our work demonstrates that cross-site performance deterioration is likely and reveals heterogeneity of risk factors across populations to be the cause. Therefore, no matter how accurate an AI model is trained at the source hospital, whether it can be adopted at target hospitals is an unanswered question. To fill the research gap, we derive a method to predict the transportability of AI models which can accelerate the adaptation process of external AI models in hospitals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sports analytics is one of the fast-growing applications of machine learning and data mining. The major goal in sport analytics applications is to make informed decisions to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse and predict lineup performance in basketball which may assist the team managers and coaches to make informed decisions. The constant lineup change in basketball games makes it vital to always have the best move ready at every moment of the game. A complex decision-making system is very important for the coaches to navigate their team through a season. This system must make the decisions based on the pros and cons of the teams, past results and lineups, and both teams’ performance under similar situations. To create this system, authors have constructed a signed, directed, and weighted network from the results of all matchups and lineups of the teams in NBA from 2007 to 2019. The proposed approach uses machine learning and graph theory to develop a new metric called Inverse Square Metric and edge-centric multi-view networks to predict the performance of a lineup in a given situation. The edge-centric approach provides a deep analysis of any condition between two teams from 16 different perspectives. The average accuracy achieved by ISM and edge-centric multi-view is 68% and 80%, respectively. In the end, the training and test datasets are chosen from different seasons and results are reasonable compared to the baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Basketball is a sport that requires full set enumeration of parameters in order to understand the game in depth and analyze the strategy and decisions by minimizing unpredictability. This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions.

	abstract = {Win prediction and performance evaluation are two core subjects in the sport analytics. Traditionally, they are treated separately and studied by two independent communities. However, this is not the intuitive way how humans interpret the matches: we predict the match results with the competition carrying on, and simultaneously evaluate each action based on the game context and its downstream impact. Predicting the match outcomes and evaluating the actions are coupled tasks, and the more accurately we predict, the better the evaluation is To this end, we develop a unified Match Tracing framework (namely, MT), for tackling the win prediction and performance evaluation jointly. The main idea of MT is to learn a real-time look-ahead win rate curve rather than a single scalar (win or lose). And the value of an action can be objectively measured with respect to the increase or decrease of the curve. To meet the low-latency restrictions of the online deployments, an efficient model equipped with recurrent attention mechanism and matrix perturbation (i.e., MT-Net) is built for learning and yielding the win rate curve. MT-Net encodes the players' behavior sequence through an attention mechanism and captures the player-interaction effects through a graph embedding method. With the action values derived from the win rate curve, performance can be quantified at different granularities (action/player/match level) by integrated analysis. Experiments on an e-sport game demonstrate the prediction effectiveness and the feasibility of the MT framework. Furthermore, we present the detailed application cases of MT, including key actions recognition and close match detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Study objective: Acute kidney injury occurs commonly and is a leading cause of prolonged hospitalization, development and progression of chronic kidney disease, and death. Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury. Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation. Results: The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two–hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours). Conclusion: Machine learning applied to routinely collected ED data identified ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury up to 72 hours before they met diagnostic criteria. Further prospective evaluation is necessary. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Head motion induced by impacts has been deemed as one of the most important measures in brain injury prediction, given that the vast majority of brain injury metrics use head kinematics as input. Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics—such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)—and brain tissue deformation-based metrics—such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods obtained significantly different (p < 0.01) values as well as substantial differences in injury classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data set of any size. The emulator and corresponding examples are available on our website<sup>1</sup>. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Player profile evaluation and player selection play a very important role in any sports and cricket is not an exception to that. In any cricket team, all players can be segregated into two main roles, namely: Batsmen and bowlers. To win a match, a team has to be comprised of the best performing players and such a scenario demands an evaluation of a player profile for team selection. Our study proposes an approach to predict batsman ranking by evaluation of a batsman's past profile. We have used a supervised machine learning technique on past data of Indian Premier League matches to produce a ranking algorithm of batsmen of an ongoing season, which can be used to gauge a batsman's performance, or to compare between different batsmen. The novelty of our approach lies in the consideration of multiple cricketing parameters, instead of only one parameter i.e. total runs scored, to design the algorithm and in the prediction of top batsmen. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The opportunity to quantitatively predict next-season injury risk in the National Hockey League (NHL) has become a reality with the advent of advanced computational processors and machine learning (ML) architecture. Unlike static regression analyses that provide a momentary prediction, ML algorithms are dynamic in that they are readily capable of imbibing historical data to build a framework that improves with additive data. Purpose: To (1) characterize the epidemiology of publicly reported NHL injuries from 2007 to 2017, (2) determine the validity of a machine learning model in predicting next-season injury risk for both goalies and position players, and (3) compare the performance of modern ML algorithms versus logistic regression (LR) analyses. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Professional NHL player data were compiled for the years 2007 to 2017 from 2 publicly reported databases in the absence of an official NHL-approved database. Attributes acquired from each NHL player from each professional year included age, 85 performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 5 ML algorithms were created for both position player and goalie data: random forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Top 3 Ensemble. LR was also performed for both position player and goalie data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 2109 position players and 213 goalies. For models predicting next-season injury risk for position players, XGBoost performed the best with an AUC of 0.948, compared with an AUC of 0.937 for LR (P <.0001). For models predicting next-season injury risk for goalies, XGBoost had the highest AUC with 0.956, compared with an AUC of 0.947 for LR (P <.0001). Conclusion: Advanced ML models such as XGBoost outperformed LR and demonstrated good to excellent capability of predicting whether a publicly reportable injury is likely to occur the next season. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Predictive models were trained with data collected by both GPS and subjective questionnaires and injury data from 40 elite male soccer players over one season. Various classification machine-learning algorithms that performed best on external and internal loads features were compared using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. In particular, tree-based algorithms based on non-linear models with an important interpretation aspect were privileged as they can help to understand internal and external load features impact on injury risk. For 1-week injury prediction, internal load features data were more accurate than external load features while for 1-month injury prediction, the best performances of classifiers were reached by combining internal and external load features. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The incidence rate of pressure injury is a critical nursing quality indicator in clinic care; consequently, factors causing pressure injury are diverse and complex. The early prevention of pressure injury and monitoring of these complex high-risk factors are critical to reduce the patients' pain, prevent further surgical treatment, avoid prolonged hospital stay, decrease the risk of wound infection, and lower associated medical costs and expenses. Although a number of risk assessment scales of pressure injury have been adopted in various countries, their criteria are set for specific populations, which may not be suitable for the medical care systems of other countries. This study constructs three prediction models of inpatient pressure injury using machine learning techniques, including decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest. A total of 11 838 inpatient records were collected, and 30 sets of training samples were adopted for data analysis in the experiment. The experimental results and evaluations of the models suggest that the prediction model built using random forest had most favorable classification performance of 0.845. The critical risk factors for pressure injury identified in this study were skin integrity, systolic blood pressure, expression ability, capillary refill time, and level of consciousness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Athletes and military personnel are both at risk of disabling injuries due to extreme physical activity. A method to predict which individuals might be more susceptible to injury would be valuable, especially in the military where basic recruits may be discharged from service due to injury. We postulate that certain body characteristics may be used to predict risk of injury with physical activity. Methods US Army basic training recruits between the ages of 17 and 21 (N = 17,680, 28% female) were scanned for uniform fitting using the 3D body imaging scanner, Human Solutions of North America at Fort Jackson, SC. From the 3D body imaging scans, a database consisting of 161 anthropometric measurements per basic training recruit was used to predict the probability of discharge from the US Army due to injury. Predictions were made using logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Model comparison was done using the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC curve. Results The ANN model outperformed two other models, (ANN, AUC = 0.70, [0.68,0.72], logistic regression AUC = 0.67, [0.62,0.72], random forest AUC = 0.65, [0.61,0.70]). Conclusions Body shape profiles generated from a three-dimensional body scanning imaging in military personnel predicted dischargeable physical injury. The ANN model can be programmed into the scanner to deliver instantaneous predictions of risk, which may provide an opportunity to intervene to prevent injury. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Conventional brain injury metrics are scalars that treat the whole head/brain as a single unit but do not characterize the distribution of brain responses. Here, we establish a network-based “response feature matrix” to characterize the magnitude and distribution of impact-induced brain strains. The network nodes and edges encode injury risks to the gray matter regions and their white matter interconnections, respectively. The utility of the metric is illustrated in injury prediction using three independent, real-world datasets: two reconstructed impact datasets from the National Football League (NFL) and Virginia Tech, respectively, and measured concussive and non-injury impacts from Stanford University. Injury predictions with leave-one-out cross-validation are conducted using the two reconstructed datasets separately, and then by combining all datasets into one. Using support vector machine, the network-based injury predictor consistently outperforms four baseline scalar metrics including peak maximum principal strain of the whole brain (MPS), peak linear/rotational acceleration, and peak rotational velocity across all five selected performance measures (e.g., maximized accuracy of 0.887 vs. 0.774 and 0.849 for MPS and rotational acceleration with corresponding positive predictive values of 0.938, 0.772, and 0.800, respectively, using the reconstructed NFL dataset). With sufficient training data, real-world injury prediction is similar to leave-one-out in-sample evaluation, suggesting the potential advantage of the network-based injury metric over conventional scalar metrics. The network-based response feature matrix significantly extends scalar metrics by sampling the brain strains more completely, which may serve as a useful framework potentially allowing for other applications such as characterizing injury patterns or facilitating targeted multi-scale modeling in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Current evaluation methods for soccer player performance either relies on rating from soccer experts or structured statistics of the match, such as shots and tackles. The former needs a lot of manpower and the evaluation is inevitably subjective. The latter can only record the quantity of a player's match events, but cannot reflect the quality (e.g., a wonderful shot or a terrible shot is regarded as a shot). To solve the above problems, an improved evaluation method for soccer player performance using affective computing is proposed. On the basis of statistics, our method also takes advantage of the text information of post-match reports, and employ the affective computing technology to quantify the quality of events. In this way, both the quantity and quality of events are considered. All the players in the Chinese Super League 2019 season are selected as evaluation objects, and the results show that the improved method can evaluate player performance more effectively and reasonably. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A penalty shot is a crucial opportunity of scoring a goal in soccer and often becomes a game-winning factor. The goalkeeper has to guess the ball flight trajectory within a fraction of a second and typically jumps to either side of the goalpost taking (often mistakenly) cues from the kicker. These cues are postulated in goalkeeper's mind based on the kicker's posture, run-up, and angle of attack at the ball. Statistical analysis of historical data helps pundits to identify beneficial strategies in such a competitive environment but these tactical knowledge is of marginal help to a novice soccer player for improving their penalty kickout and blocking skills. Oftentimes, players are not equally skilled at successfully placing the ball around different sections of the goalpost. To empower players with a retrospective view of their performance and identifying the strong versus weak shots, and blocking capabilities, it's crucial to detect the direction, force, and trajectory of the shots. In this work, we propose a wearable sensor-based approach to detect the outcome of various goal shots from the kicker's dominant foot movement profile. We empirically assign six hot-zones inside the goal post and collect data on a real-life penalty shoot-out using economically available accelerometer sensors from four participants. We develop a deep learning approach for the shot classification and we report superior (53%) accuracy over traditional approaches (47%) in a challenging setting of recognizing different goal shots from the segmented data stream. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Drug-Induced Liver Injury (Dili) is a major cause of failed drug candidates in clinical trials and withdrawal of approved drugs from the market. Therefore, machine learning-based Dili prediction can be key in increasing the success rate of drug discovery because drug candidates that are predicted to potentially induce liver injury can be rejected before clinical trials. However, existing Dili prediction models mainly focus on the chemical structures of drugs. Since we cannot determine whether a drug will cause liver injury based solely on its structure, Dili prediction based on the transcriptional effect of a drug on a cell is necessary. In this paper, we propose GLIT which is a model that uses transcriptional response data and chemical structures and can be used for drug-induced liver injury prediction. GLIT learns the embedding vectors of drug structures and drug-induced gene expression profiles using graph attention networks in a biological knowledge graph for predicting Dili. GLIT outperformed a baseline model that uses only drug structure information by 7% and 19.2% in terms of correct classification rate (CCR) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively. In addition, we conducted a literature survey to confirm whether the class labels of drugs, in the unknown Dili class, predicted by GLIT are correct. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper adopts STEAMS (Science, Technology, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Math, Statistics) methodology. The objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements, especially living in the Big Data World. The NBA Draft Position case study was demonstrated to present this novel “STEAMS” concept as compared to the current “STEM” or” STEAM” approach. There are three core visions of this “STEAMS” methodology: (1) replace “Art” with “Artificial Intelligence”, (2) separate “Statistics” from “Math”, and (3) integrate all six “STEAMS” elements. Adding the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions. Due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements is becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern Big Data era. Several techniques are used to help determine the NBA Player position and identify the similar NBA players for the benchmarking objective. It’s critical and urgent for educators and teachers to abandon the traditional STEM approach to adopt the new “STEAMS” approach to educate our next generations in their early school learning and career development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Firstly, a dataset containing box scores and Dean's four factors for regular seasons from 2004-2005 to 2017-2018 has been prepared. Then, box scores and four factors have been used as classification independent variables, to predict the winner of matches involving the Golden State Warriors team. Both CART and Random Forests machine learning techniques have been applied, and quality of fitting analyzed. Variable importance of fitted models has been studied to identify success drivers showing how, for Golden State Warriors, defense is a key factor to win a game. At last, these models are shown to be suitable for coaching staff in game preparation, and CART models are shown to be valuable on the basketball court for match interpretation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning (ML) allows for the development of a predictive algorithm capable of imbibing historical data on a Major League Baseball (MLB) player to accurately project the player's future availability. Purpose: To determine the validity of an ML model in predicting the next-season injury risk and anatomic injury location for both position players and pitchers in the MLB. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Using 4 online baseball databases, we compiled MLB player data, including age, performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 84 ML algorithms were developed. The output of each algorithm reported whether the player would sustain an injury the following season as well as the injury’s anatomic site. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 1931 position players and 1245 pitchers, with a mean follow-up of 4.40 years (13,982 player-years) between the years of 2000 and 2017. Injured players spent a total of 108,656 days on the disabled list, with a mean of 34.21 total days per player. The mean AUC for predicting next-season injuries was 0.76 among position players and 0.65 among pitchers using the top 3 ensemble classification. Back injuries had the highest AUC among both position players and pitchers, at 0.73. Advanced ML models outperformed logistic regression in 13 of 14 cases. Conclusion: Advanced ML models generally outperformed logistic regression and demonstrated fair capability in predicting publicly reportable next-season injuries, including the anatomic region for position players, although not for pitchers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has long been recognized as a common and important complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). In the study, machine learning (ML) techniques were used to establish predictive models for AKI in AP patients during hospitalization. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of AP patients admitted within one week after the onset of abdominal pain to our department from January 2014 to January 2019. Eighty patients developed AKI after admission (AKI group) and 254 patients did not (non-AKI group) in the hospital. With the provision of additional information such as demographic characteristics or laboratory data, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to build models of AKI prediction and compared to the predictive performance of the classic model using logistic regression (LR). XGBoost performed best in predicting AKI with an AUC of 91.93% among the machine learning models. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 87.28%. Present findings suggest that compared to the classical logistic regression model, machine learning models using features that can be easily obtained at admission had a better performance in predicting AKI in the AP patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of machine learning to identify and classify offensive and defensive strategies in team sports through spatio-temporal tracking data has received significant interest recently in the literature and the global sport industry. This paper focuses on data-driven defensive strategy learning in basketball. Most research to date on basketball strategylearning has focused on offensive effectiveness and is based on the interaction between the on-ball player and principleon-ball defender, thereby ignoring the contribution of the remaining players. Furthermore, most sports analytical systems that provide play-by-play data is heavily biased towards offensive metrics such as passes, dribbles, and shots. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning to classify the different defensive strategies basketball players adopt when deviating from their initial defensive action. An analytical model was developed to recognise the one-on-one (matched) relationships of the players, which is utilised to automatically identify any change of defensive strategy. A classification model is developed based on a player and ball tracking dataset from National Basketball Association (NBA) game play to classify the adopted defensive strategy against pick-and-roll play. The methodology described is the first toanalyse the defensive strategy of all in-game players (both on-ball players and off-ball players). The cross-validation results indicate that the proposed technique for automatic defensive strategy identification can achieve up to 69% accuracy of classification. Machine learning techniques, such as the one adopted here, have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of player decision making and defensive game strategies in basketball and other sports, by leveraging the player and ball tracking data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
