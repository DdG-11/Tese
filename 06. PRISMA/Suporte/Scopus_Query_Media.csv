The analysis and modeling of basketball game data have long been central topics in sports analytics. In recent years, integrating machine learning techniques has facilitated significant advancements in predicting basketball game outcomes. However, most existing studies predominantly focus on NBA data, with relatively limited exploration of other leagues. To address this research gap, this study utilizes game data from the Chinese Basketball Association spanning the 2021–2024 seasons to develop predictive models. This research is the first to apply the classical Four Factors model and DefenseOfense model, along with their derivative versions (Four Factors detailed model and DefenseOfense detailed model), to the Chinese Men’s Professional Basketball League, providing a baseline for prediction. To ensure practical applicability of the models and enable their effective use in real-world scenarios, this study exclusively uses data available before the start of each game as feature variables for training. This approach ensures that the enhanced models can perform well in theoretical evaluations and provide reliable predictions when applied in practice. To evaluate model performance, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron with contrastive loss, and XGBoost are employed, with metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and AUROC used for comparison. The results reveal that the incorporation of additional features substantially enhances predictive performance. In particular, under the Logistic Regression framework, the newly developed model based on the Four Factors detailed achieves an accuracy of 85.49%, representing the highest predictive performance among all the evaluated approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010155818"

By merging physiological signals i.e., Heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, muscle activation patterns, with psychological signals i.e., mental toughness, athlete engagement, group cohesion along with contextual training data, we create a hybrid model that performs superiorly as compared to traditional unidimensional models. Our exercisers were trained using a gradient boosting and neural network to learn the very complex non-linear relationships that exist between the physical and the psychological performance drivers. With a rich sample set of 480 athletes from different sports, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy (R2 = 0.90) in predicting performance outcomes and outdid the conventional methods with statistical approaches R2 = 0.77) and machine learning based methods (R2 = 0.77) And machine whiz methods. The robust results achieved from the model (over 90%) as compared to conventional nor statistical methods. From the analysis of the features’ importance, the strongest predictor of performance are the Provided Dedicated Athletes’ scores of the Functional Movement Screening (13.7%), athlete dedication (11.5%), maximum acceleration capabilities (10.2%), which verify the relationship along biomechanical, preconceived explosive power and psychological commitment. This reflects the finding whereby deep categorized athletic talent prediction requires a multi-dimensional approach by sophisticated fusion techniques. The framework is useful to coaches and sports scientists because it allows for the individualized design of injury risk mitigation and physiologically and psychologically-focused interpersonal help. This approach integrates multiple factors and constitutes an important progress in sports analytics by providing a comprehensive perspective on the complex realities which influence elite athletic performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004685126"

The current use of vision sensors for HSAR is a difficult task due to the intricate movements involved in sports and fitness workouts, as well as fluctuations in illumination conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) and their usage for human sports activities classification based on sensor data called ML-HSAR is presented in this article. A dataset containing 19 different human activities gathered from 8 different people through different types of sensors was used for this work; the dataset contains activities like sitting and standing, as well as other activities that require serious movements, such as running, cycling, and playing basketball. This study primarily aims to determine the performance of the considered ML models in accurately classifying these activities found in the dataset. The training of the algorithms and the subsequent evaluation were done on the segmented sensor data, effectively leveraging the dataset’s temporal aspect. In addition to the presented results for each of these algorithms, the limitations of each algorithm and their strengths in handling the complexities involved in HSAR were also presented.

Despite notable advancements driven by deep learning approaches, BAR remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of basketball movements, frequent occlusions, and limited availability of standardized benchmark datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured synthesis of current developments in BAR research, encompassing four principal dimensions: dataset curation, computational methodologies, synthetic data generation, and model explainability. A critical analysis of publicly available basketball-specific datasets is presented, delineating their modalities, annotation strategies, action taxonomies, and representational scope. Furthermore, the survey offers a structured classification of state-of-the-art action recognition methodologies, ranging from video-based and skeleton-based models to sensor-driven and multimodal fusion approaches, emphasizing architectural characteristics, evaluation protocols, and task-specific adaptations. The role of synthetic data is systematically examined as a means to address data scarcity, reduce annotation noise, and enhance model generalization through controlled variability and simulation-based augmentation. In parallel, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques is also analyzed, with a focus on post-hoc attribution methods, probabilistic reasoning models, and interpretable neural architectures, aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of decision-making processes. The survey identifies persisting research challenges, including dataset heterogeneity, limitations in cross-domain transferability, and the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in deep models. By delineating current limitations and prospective directions, this work provides a foundational reference to guide the development of robust, generalizable, and explainable BAR systems for deployment in real-world sports intelligence applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012934994"

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization.

However, challenges such as the lack of domain-specific datasets and the complexity of athletes’ movements continue to hinder progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced pose estimation framework tailored to badminton players, built upon an improved YOLOv8-Pose architecture. In particular, we introduce an efficient local attention (ELA) mechanism that effectively captures fine-grained spatial dependencies and contextual information, thereby significantly improving the keypoint localization accuracy and overall pose estimation performance. To support this study, we construct a dedicated badminton pose dataset comprising 4000 manually annotated samples, captured using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The raw data undergo careful processing and refinement through a combination of depth-assisted annotation and visual inspection to ensure high-quality ground truth keypoints. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple attention modules and their integration strategies within the network, offering generalizable insights to enhance pose estimation models in other sports domains. The experimental results show that the proposed ELA-enhanced YOLOv8-Pose model consistently achieves superior accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), object keypoint similarity (OKS), and percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), highlighting its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sports vision tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011870922"

Despite its promise, challenges such as the lack of comprehensive datasets, limited use of advanced ML techniques, insufficient focus on tactical decision-making, and the underutilization of predictive analytics in training remain prevalent. To develop a predictive model that analyzes technical and tactical decisions in badminton, enhancing strategy development and performance evaluation for competitive gameplay, the proposed method, Puffer Fish Algorithm-tuned Intelligent Support Vector Machine (PFA-INT-SVM), combines the benefits of Pufferfish mutation with INT-SVM to improve prediction accuracy and classification tasks. The model utilizes data that encompasses player performance metrics, shot types, match context, opponent behavior, physical conditions, environmental factors, and tactical decisions. One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features, while normalization standardizes numerical data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that PFA-INT-SVM significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This model effectively predicts player performance and match outcomes, showing promising potential for enhancing badminton strategy development and analysis.

This study proposes a real-time goal state recognition system based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, focusing on four shooting scenarios: rebounds, swishes, other shots, and misses. By installing IMU sensors around the basketball net, the system captures real-time data on acceleration, angular velocity, and angular changes to comprehensively analyze the fluency and success rate of shooting execution, utilizing five deep learning models—convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM-Attention—to classify shot types. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM-Attention model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 87.79% in identifying goal states. This result represents a commanding level of real-time goal state recognition, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the model in complex sports environments.

HPE, a fundamental task in applications such as sports analytics and surveillance systems, involves predicting human joint locations from visual data. Despite substantial progress driven by deep learning advancements, particularly in handling occlusions and crowded environments, a comprehensive integration of these innovations remains limited in current literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel HPE and SEC system featuring a robust six-stage pipeline. The workflow begins with preprocessing steps, including video-to-image sequence conversion, floor removal to reduce noise, grayscale transformation, and human silhouette extraction via binary masks. Human detection is performed using the GrabCut algorithm. Full-body feature extraction incorporates 1-D Fourier Transform, 2-D energy-based motion analysis, 0–180° intensity mapping via the Radon Transform algorithm, and movable body part detection using Fourier-Based Correlation. Key point features are characterized through the degree of freedom, human landmark detection via the HSV algorithm, and angular point analysis using the media pipe algorithm. Features are then optimized using the Ray Optimizer and classified through a Neuro-Fuzzy classifier. The proposed system achieves classification accuracies of 94.82%, 92.33%, and 93.63% on the UCF Sports Actions, Human Action Recognition (HAR), and MPII Human Pose datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling real-world challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000722956"

This paper proposes a novel AI-driven image recognition system for automatically detecting offside and foul events in football matches. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention or traditional image processing techniques, our approach utilizes a hybrid deep learning model that combines advanced object tracking with motion analysis to deliver real-time, precise event detection. The system employs a robust, self-learning algorithm that leverages spatiotemporal features from match footage to track player movements and ball dynamics. By analyzing the continuous flow of video data, the model detects offside positions and identifies foul types such as tackles, handballs, and dangerous play—through a dynamic pattern recognition process. This multi- tiered approach overcomes traditional methods’ limitations by accurately identifying critical events with minimal latency, even in complex, high-speed scenarios. In experiments conducted on diverse datasets of live match footage, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.85% for offside detection and 98.56% for foul identification, with precision rates of 98.32% and 97.12%, respectively.

PassAI addresses these challenges with an original dual-stream architecture that processes image-based and tabular features separately and then combines them for final prediction. Additionally, a two-stage explanation module was implemented to provide interpretable insights from both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. This module allows end users (e.g., coaches and analysts) understand whether pass outcomes depend more on contextual dynamics or individual player traits.

These limitations hinder optimal rehabilitation and prolong recovery times. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating robotic-assisted assessment with personalized sports analytics. Our approach utilizes a Dynamic Sports Performance Network (DSPN), which combines spatiotemporal data analysis, reinforcement learning, and real-time feedback mechanisms to optimize exercise recommendations. By incorporating multi-agent learning and predictive modeling, the system adapts rehabilitation plans based on patient performance, ensuring a tailored and effective recovery process. The system can integrate wearable sensor data and EMG signals to further refine exercise precision and monitor muscular responses in real time. Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional rehabilitation strategies, offering higher precision in exercise recommendations, improved adherence rates, and enhanced recovery efficiency. Discussion: This research provides a new direction in robotic-assisted rehabilitation, bridging the gap between sports science, intelligent systems, and urologic oncology recovery through interdisciplinary innovation and patient-centered design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010945276"

This paper addresses the critical problem of inconsistent and non-adaptive performance benchmarking, which limits objective comparisons across players, teams, and historical data. We propose a novel data-driven framework leveraging machine learning (ML) to create an adaptive benchmarking system that automatically evaluates performance trends, identifies anomalies, and provides actionable insights. Our approach integrates deep learning, reinforcement learning, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale datasets, including biometrics, match statistics, and contextual variables. A key innovation is the hybrid ML pipeline combining supervised and unsupervised learning, where neural networks and clustering algorithms work together to dynamically rank and compare athlete performances based on evolving game conditions. Furthermore, we introduce anomaly detection and regression-based models to detect deviations from expected performance trends and offer personalized recommendations for training optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving superior accuracy in performance evaluation compared to conventional statistical methods. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to enhance transparency and ensure interpretability of model outputs for coaches, analysts, and athletes. By addressing the limitations of static performance assessment methods, this research establishes a new paradigm for data-driven decision-making in sports, offering a scalable and AI-driven approach for talent identification, injury prevention, and strategic game planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010769028"

This task poses significant challenges due to the inherently interactive and unpredictable nature of sports, where abrupt changes in velocity and direction are prevalent. Traditional approaches, including (S)ARIMA(X), Kalman filters (KF), and Particle filters (PF), often struggle to model the non-linear dynamics present in such scenarios. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers, offer greater flexibility and accuracy but frequently fail to explicitly capture the interplay between temporal dependencies and contextual interactions, which are critical in chaotic sports environments.In this paper, we evaluate these models and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results reveal key performance trade-offs across input history length, generalizability, and the ability to incorporate contextual information. ML-based methods demonstrated substantial improvements over linear models across forecast horizons of up to 2s. Among the tested architectures, our hybrid LSTM augmented with contextual information achieved the lowest final displacement error (FDE) of 1.51m, outperforming temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN), graph attention network (GAT), and Transformers, while also requiring less data and training time compared to GAT and Transformers.

This study employed Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) and various ML algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to create a robust, explainable model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) model was used to enhance model interpretability. Results: The K-means Cluster Analysis categorized teams into groups (TOP TEAMS, 3 teams/REST TEAMS, 17 teams), and the ML models provided significant insights into the factors influencing league standings. The LR classifier was the best-performing classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75.13%, a recall of 76.32%, an F1-score of 48.03%, and a precision of 35.17%. “SHORT PASSES” and “THROUGH BALLS” were features found to positively influence the model’s predictions, while “TACKLES ATTEMPTED” and “LONG BALLS” had a negative impact. Conclusions: Our model provided satisfactory predictive accuracy and clear interpretability of results, which gave useful information to stakeholders. Specifically, our model suggests adopting a strategy during the ball possession phase that relies on short passes (avoiding long ones) and aiming to enter the attacking third and the opponent’s penalty area with through balls. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205251794"

Because such data is extremely rich and complex, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Designing these indicators requires paying careful attention to a number of subtle issues from a methodological and evaluation perspective. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for handling them. Methodologically, we highlight that dependencies affect how to perform data partitioning for evaluation as well as the need to consider contextual factors. From an evaluation perspective, we draw a distinction between evaluating the developed indicators themselves versus the underlying models that power them. We argue that both aspects must be considered, but that they require different approaches.

Analyzing different types of plays (e.g., corner, penalty, free kicks) requires different considerations. This work focuses on the analysis of corner kick plays. However, the central ideas apply to analyzing all types of plays. While prior analyses (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) have explored the link between contextual factors (e.g., match period, type of defensive marking) and the level of success of a corner kick (e.g., shot, shot on goal, goal), there has been no attempt to combine spatiotemporal event data (sequences of ball movements through the field) and contextual information to determine when and how (strategy) a particular type of corner kick play (tactic) is more likely to succeed or not. To address this gap, we propose an approach that (1) transforms spatiotemporal data into an alternative representation suitable for mining sequential patterns, (2) identifies and characterizes the sequential patterns used by offensive teams to move the ball toward the scoring zone (tactics), and (3) extracts contrast patterns to identify under what conditions different tactics result in increased chances of success or failure; we call these conditions strategies. Our results suggest that favorable and unfavorable conditions for tactic application are not the same across different tactics, supporting the argument that there is a benefit in performing an analysis that treats different tactics separately, where spatiotemporal information plays a crucial role. Unlike prior works on the corner kick, our approach can capture how the interaction between multiple contextual factors impacts the outcome of a corner kick. At the same time, the results can be explained to others in natural languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192502714"

The work attempts to provide more precise and timely forecasts, which are crucial for efficient sports analytics, by utilizing the spatial nuances seen in athlete score photographs. We compiled a diverse collection of annotated athlete score photos from several sports settings in an effort to achieve real-time athlete score prediction. We designed an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, and adapted it for the extraction of spatial features. The Convolution Neural Network was carefully trained with the Adam optimisation method, and its accuracy and loss metrics were continuously monitored. A comprehensive comparison study utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) evaluated important performance metrics such as precision, computational effectiveness, and instantaneous inference capabilities. Convolution Neural Network is a powerful tool for improving real-time sports analytics. This was demonstrated by the integration of the trained Convolution Neural Network model into a real-time athlete scoring system, which involved optimizing processing pipelines for low-latency performance without sacrificing prediction accuracy. The Convolution Neural Network based feature extraction technique has better accuracy of 89.28% than the Recurrent Neural Network with 79.41 %. The statistical significance value obtained is 0.760 (p>0.05),hence it is observed that there is no statistical significant difference between the two groups. The sample records were measured with the help of clinical analysis, the value of alpha is 0.05, the value of beta is 0.5, percentage of confidence is 95.

This study uses machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning clustering and decision tree models, to predict the composition of a winning roster. Our research identified three distinct clusters based on win percentage and the distribution of players across different skill levels. Successful teams typically have more top-tier players and a significant representation of players in the lowest skill level. In contrast, teams that spread their talent across the entire roster are less successful. We have noticed that players with average to above-average skills are notably affected by excessive playing time in the previous game, which leads to decreased performance and potential losses for the team in the next game. Considering the time of year and the gap between games, we recommend prioritizing the rest and recovery of top players, especially in the latter half of the season. It's crucial to ensure that players who are not as skilled as the top players but still make significant contributions to the team maintain consistent performance, especially during the first half of the season. Analyzing height's impact on basketball player performance has revealed practical insights that can empower coaches and management. We found that the shortest and tallest players often perform less than those of average height. Most top performers in the NBA tend to have heights closer to the average. However, for players who frequently operate near the net and encounter numerous rebound opportunities, it is generally preferable to have an average or taller player for slightly enhanced overall performance compared to below-average height players. Teams can use these insights to improve their roster construction and maximize player utilization by coaches from one game to the next. This research provides practical strategies that can be immediately implemented to enhance team performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219153488"

Effective and data-driven training can reduce injury related to over-exertion and boost player performance. Shooting is a crucial skill in soccer and can significantly influence the outcome of a game. This work addresses the lack of a smart and privacy-aware device to track and analyze players' shot localization accuracy, particularly for amateur players. We investigate a smart soccer net that can localize the point of impact of the ball from the perturbations of small inertial measuring sensors attached to the net. We train a feedforward neural network with raw data and statistical-based features, and a convolutional neural network with time- and frequency-based features from continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Also, we investigated one, two, three, and four sensors deployed in selected configurations on the net. Four sensors deployed in a rhombus configuration and a model trained with CWT-based features achieved the best classification accuracy of 94 %. A cost-effective option of using three sensors in an inverted triangle configuration and the model trained with statistical-based features achieved 90 % accuracy.

Standard pattern recognition methods typically require the collection of data to be centralized, which is quite problematic in terms of privacy and limits the number of available datasets. The FL method is applied as a collaborative approach to training models with distributed datasets where privacy is maintained while the set datasets are augmented to improve the resulting model. Comparison was also made of the FL CNN architecture with that of a conventional centralized structure. The FL model reached a classification accuracy of 92.5%, Precision of 93.2%, and Recall of 91. 8%, and the F1-score was equal to 92. 5%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the centralized model I achieved was 89. 70% for centrepiece agreement and a precision rate of 90. 5%, a recall rate of 88.Therefore, the percentage increases by 5%, and the median and metamorphotic increases by 19%.

This paper introduces an innovative approach to tracking active players in handball videos using a fusion of the Multi-Deep SORT algorithm and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The novel integration aims to enhance player appearance for robust and precise tracking in dynamic gameplay. The system starts with a GAN model trained on annotated handball video data, generating synthetic frames to improve the visual quality and realism of player appearances, thereby refining the input data for tracking. The Multi-Deep SORT algorithm, enhanced with GAN-generated features, improves object association and continuous player tracking. This framework addresses key challenges in active player tracking, handling occlusions, variations in player appearances, and complex interactions. Additionally, GAN-based enhancements improve accuracy in distinguishing active from inactive players, facilitating precise localization and recognition. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's efficacy in achieving high tracking accuracy, robustness, and differentiation between player activity levels. Metrics such as Average Precision (AP), Average Recall (AR), accuracy, and F1-score affirm the system's advancement in active player tracking. This pioneering fusion of Multi-Deep SORT with GAN-based player appearance enhancement sets a new standard for precise, robust, and context-aware active player tracking in handball videos. It offers comprehensive insights for coaches, analysts, and players to optimize team strategies and performance.

Coaches rely on analytics to scout opponents and optimize play calls in gameplay. With the advancement in artificial intelligence, accessible and in-depth data collection has been enabled. The well-grounded technique for performance evaluation in sports analytics is Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Our focus is on real-time action recognition in combat sports like boxing. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are heavily parameterized, so can’t be used in real-time in any low-end devices. Apart from this, fine-grained classification in highly dynamic activities in sports are typically performed using sensors only. Our proposed Machine Learning based pipeline provides real-time fine-grained solution for 14 boxing punch types of classification using RGB video only. Our approach includes the implementation of three novel and generalized motion dynamics features that encode velocity as well as acceleration of the pose sequences., 1) Unified-Axis Angular Encoding (UAE), 2) 2D Motion Dynamics Descriptors (2DMDD), 3) Fifth-order Angular Encoding (FAE). We employed classical machine learning algorithms I.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to make a lightweight model and test it on YouTube videos. The average accuracies of pipeline using the proposed features are found to be 55%, 92% and 84% for UAE, 2DMDD, and FAE respectively.

This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization.

The paper proposes a new deep learning-based prediction approach for One Day International (ODI) cricket, using Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with an attention mechanism. While traditional machine learning-based models have shown some promise, they still suffer from the inability to capture long-term dependencies within a cricket match sequential data. The LSTM architecture inherently tends to learn these temporal patterns really well; hence, it is particularly suited for this task. The attention mechanism further enhances this model, where the critical moments in the match are solely responsible for the outcome. Based on this, detection will be done with an extensive dataset covering more than matches of various cricket formats: ODI, T20I, and Test matches. The dataset is a collection from ESPNcricinfo and other official cricket databases, including ball-by-ball information with relevant contextual features: performance metrics from teams, player statistics, weather conditions, and venue information.

Technological developments and the growing uses of human activity recognition (HAR) in various industries, including healthcare, sports analytics, and human-computer interface, are responsible for the growing interest. Deep learning techniques are the most promising of the different approaches to HAR because of their capacity to extract intricate patterns from enormous datasets. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing human activities utilizing 3D skeleton information. A wide range of human movements can be accurately recognized and categorized using this method, which makes use of deep learning's capabilities. The center parts of our approach are illustrated as Joint Position Scaling and Temporal Alignment. After normalization, the 3D skeleton data is represented in two different forms like Spatial Representation and Temporal Representation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been employed on the features extracted from the deep neural network to improve our model's classification accuracy. The output from the second last layer of the neural network is used to train the SVM, allowing it to draw a decision boundary that effectively divides movements of gait. Bayesian Optimization technique has been used to adjust each hyperparameter to make sure our model was resilient.

A large dataset of 14,146 serves from 97 Davis Cup doubles matches played between 2010 and 2019 was analyzed using explainable AI techniques. The angle and distance from the bounce to the sidelines of the serves were found to best distinguish the points won with aces from rallies lasting more than three strokes. Optimal serve angle ranges of 5.7–8.7° substantially increased the probability of serving an ace by over 80%, compared to around 30% when serving used more central angles. Lateral bounce distances of 0–28 cm from the sidelines also boosted the ace probability by over 50%. The serve speed was shown to have less influence on serve effectiveness as compared to singles tennis, with velocities above 187 km h−1 only increasing the probability of serving an ace by 10%. These findings have important practical implications for the tactical decision-making and technical training of serves in men’s professional doubles tennis. The data highlight that the angle and placement of serves are more important than velocity for attaining effective serves in doubles. Coaches and players can use this knowledge to pay special attention to the most important variables in the effectiveness of serves, such as the line distance and angle, in order to maximize the performance of the doubles serve.

These techniques enable sports analysts to evaluate player performance more effectively. A literature review of player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A novel framework was proposed to evaluate batsman strength based on individual performance, role in the team, and team interactions. Traditionally, proposed ranking systems are derived from static networks, that is, the aggregation of game results over time. However, the scores of the players (or teams) fluctuate over time. Intuitively, defeating a renowned player during peak performance is more rewarding than defeating the same player during other periods. To account for this, we propose a new method and apply it to the T20 format Indian Premier League. The method serves three main purposes: First, it creates a new performance index for players to rank them more accurately and effectively. Second, the players are clustered based on their expertise. In the third phase, a social network analysis approach is applied to visualize and analyze crickets as a network to gain better insights into players’ team interactions.

However, one of the major challenges is the difficulty of automated acquisition of continuous movement data during sports matches. In particular, it is a conundrum to reliably track a tiny ball on a wide soccer pitch with obstacles such as occlusion and imitations. Tackling the problem, this paper proposes an inference framework of ball trajectory from player trajectories as a cost-efficient alternative to ball tracking. We combine Set Transformers to get permutation-invariant and equivariant representations of the multi-agent contexts with a hierarchical architecture that intermediately predicts the player ball possession to support the final trajectory inference. Also, we introduce the reality loss term and postprocessing to secure the estimated trajectories to be physically realistic.

It contributes to exciting and unpredictable play, which can help teams to overcome defensive strategies and create scoring opportunities. Consequently, evaluating the creative abilities of players is an important aspect of the player recruitment process. However, there is currently no clear way to measure creativity in soccer. It is not captured by the typical result-based performance indicators, as being creative entails going beyond just doing something useful, to accomplishing something useful but in a unique or atypical way. Therefore in this paper, we define a novel metric to quantify the level of creativity involved in a player's passes. Our Creative Decision Rating (CDR) utilizes machine learning techniques to assess two important factors: the originality of a pass, and its value in terms of increasing the team's chances of scoring a goal. We validated our metric on StatsBomb 360 contextual event stream data of the 2021/22 English Premier League season and show through a number of use cases that it provides another angle on a player's skill, complementing existing player evaluation metrics. Overall, our metric provides a concise method for capturing and quantifying the creativity of soccer players and could have important implications for player recruitment and talent development in the sport. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171338042"

This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and women's singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players' tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164887421"

As this problem has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing work on representing strategic relations among players’ shot types and movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion for Movement Forecasting model (DyMF) with interaction style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and between both players within a rally, and dynamic players’ tactics across time. In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods and demonstrate the practical usage of movement forecasting.

For appropriate recommendations to the team management and the team players, there is a need to predict the match and quantify the important factors for which prediction models need to be developed. The second thing required is identifying talented and emerging players and performing an associative analysis of the important factors to the match-winning outcome. This paper formulates a hybrid machine learning-clustering-associative rules model. This paper also implements the framework for cricket matches, one of the most popular sports globally watched by billions around the world. We predict the match outcome for One day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty 20 s (T20s) (two formats of Cricket representing fifty over and twenty over versions respectively) adopting state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep neural networks. The variable importance is computed using machine-learning techniques and further statistically validated through the regression model. The emerging talented players are identified by clustering. Association rules are generated for determining the best possible winning outcome. The results show that environmental conditions are equally crucial for determining a match result, as are internal quantitative factors. The model is thus helpful for both team management and for players to improve their winning strategy and also for discovering emerging players to form an unbeatable team. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125772148"

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However, converting the sensor information to 3-D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Toward solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), encoder-decoder networks, and ResNets to extract 3-D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3-D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. In addition, this article validates the feasibility of mirrored bilateral training approach with applications in prosthetic devices. Finally, NeuroPose is comprehensively evaluated on both low-end and recent smartphones with a processing latency of 0.019 s and low energy overhead. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144083351"

We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits.

Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance.

In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, aiming to extract valuable insights from large volumes of cricket data. Cricket has many fans in India. With a strong fan following, many try to use their cricket intuition to predict the outcome of a match. A set of rules and a points system govern the game. The venue and the performance of each player greatly affect the outcome of the match. The game is difficult to predict accurately as the various components are closely related. The CRR (Current Run Rate) approach is used to predict the final score of the first innings of a cricket match. Total points are calculated by multiplying the average number of runs scored in each over by the total number of overs. For ODI cricket, these methods are useless as the game can change very quickly regardless of the current run rate. The game may be decided by 1 or 2 overs. For more accurate score predictions, a system is needed that can more accurately predict the outcome of an inning. This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict scores and classify players based on their roles in the squad. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of cricket matches, including player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest regression models are employed to predict scores. Additionally, player categorization is performed using a classification approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in enhancing performance analysis and decision-making in the game of cricket. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184821608"

In this paper, a machine learning-based (ML) strategy for forecasting football match results is presented. In the past, the number of goals scored by each team in a football (FB) game served as a benchmark for assessing a team's performance and projecting future outcomes to forecast the results of football games, such as win, draw, or defeat. However, there are significant discrepancies between a team's performance and the number of goals scored or conceded throughout many games because the number of goals scored during a match contains a significant random element.The goal of this study is to create an accurate and dependable prediction model that will help fans, analysts, and bet enthusiasts make wise selections. The selection of features, treatment of data that is imbalanced and the generalization of models constitute significant issues that are addressed in this paper. The system learns patterns from previous encounters and player attributes to develop predictions for upcoming games. Various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and regression, are experimented with. The main goal of this research is to investigate various Machine Learning techniques to forecast football game results utilizing in-game match events and individual and team statistics off the field.As football remains a globally popular sport, the integration of machine learning for match prediction offers an exciting avenue for enthusiasts to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of the game. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183530345"

To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters, it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the 2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161463130"

Artificial intelligence techniques such as predictive analysis, automatic highlight generation, and assistant coaching have been applied to improve performance and decision-making for teams and players. To perform any high-level analysis from a game match, collecting the locations (where) and identities (who) of players is crucial and challenging. In this paper, a universal JErsey number DEtector (JEDE) for player identification is presented that predicts players' bounding boxes and keypoints, along with bounding boxes and classes of jersey digits and numbers in an end-to-end manner. Instead of generating digit proposals from pre-defined anchors, JEDE predicts more robust proposals guided by players' features and pose estimation. Moreover, a dataset is collected from soccer and basketball matches with annotations on players' bounding boxes and body keypoints, and jersey digits' bounding boxes and labels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the collected dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Both quantitative and qualitative results also demonstrate JEDE's superior practicality and generalizability over different sports. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133731619"

Such applications not only play an important role during matches but also have a great influence on the training stage. However, applying deep learning techniques to sports analytics has several technical challenges, which also remain untouched in badminton analytics as there is no public dataset of stroke event records. Therefore, this dissertation intends to explore challenging research questions and application issues that have not been addressed for benefiting both the research and badminton communities. To achieve the objectives, we, for the first time, propose a unified badminton language to describe the process of the shot, which enables us to conduct downstream applications. Specifically, our first task is to measure the win probability of each shot in badminton matches by considering long-term and short-term dependencies. Second, we introduce a framework with two encoder-decoder extractors and a position-aware fusion network to forecast the possible tactics of players, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. To provide the transparency of these models, we aim to design a post-hoc explainer by computing feature attributions with Shapley values as the third task. In this manner, researchers can investigate model behaviors for advanced improvement, and the badminton community benefits from coaching the players and determining the strategies.

One important task in this context is the performance measurement of individual players to provide reports and log files for subsequent analysis. During sport events like basketball, this involves the re-identification of players during a match either from multiple camera viewpoints or from a single camera viewpoint at different times. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the out-standing zero-shot performance of pre-Trained CLIP models to the domain of player re-identification. For this purpose we reformulate the contrastive language-To-image pre-Training approach from CLIP to a contrastive image-To-image training approach using the InfoNCE loss as training objective. Unlike previous work, our approach is entirely class-Agnostic and benefits from large-scale pre-Training. With a fine-Tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 model we achieve 98.44% mAP on the MMSports 2022 Player Re-Identification challenge. Furthermore we show that the CLIP Vision Transformers have already strong OCR capabilities to identify useful player features like shirt numbers in a zero-shot manner without any fine-Tuning on the dataset. By applying the Score-CAM algorithm we visualise the most important image regions that our fine-Tuned model identifies when calculating the similarity score between two images of a player. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141431894"

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction.

Secondly, we discover the present status of AI use in elite sports. Therefore, in addition to another literature review, we interviewed leading sports scientist, which are closely connected to the main national service institute for elite sports in their countries. The analysis of this literature review and the interviews show that the most activity is carried out in the methodical categories of signal and image processing.

Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-Time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity.

This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075933396"

These tasks generally involve object detection and tracking operations that require pre-processing the video through expensive machine learning models. To address this cost, several video query optimizers have recently been proposed. Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies. We compare OTIF against three recent video query optimizers, as well as several general-purpose object detection and tracking techniques, and find that, across multiple datasets, OTIF provides a 6x to 25x average reduction in the overall cost to execute five queries over the same video. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132450665"

Machine learning algorithms are having a significant impact on sports analytics and cricket is one of them. By using machine learning techniques, we can create new methodologies, predict player performance and select a team for the next matches or series by predicting player performance. The proposed model is made out of statistical information from reputable sports sources and websites on the best ODI players for the Indian national cricket team. The performance of the players depends on various factors such as the opposition team, the venue, and the number of balls faced by the batsman. This paper makes an attempt to forecast the performance of batsmen based on several features. The main motive behind this study is to predict batsmen performance based on available data using different Regression models like Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DT), Random Forest (RF) Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and evaluate which model is best for the prediction of different batsmen performance. Over the past few years, Fantasy sports have experienced tremendous growth, with a burgeoning fan base. Participants in fantasy sports can assemble fictitious teams from actual players. This project was motivated by the desire to assist selectors in predicting and identifying players who would do well in upcoming ODI series as well as provide sports fans with a pleasant way to interact with statistics and assist them in building their ideal teams on fantasy sports using our model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150677777"

Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Unfortunately, how to evaluate the use of machine learning in the context of sports remains extremely challenging. On the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the developed indicators themselves, where one is confronted by a lack of labels and small sample sizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate the models themselves, which is complicated by the noisy and non-stationary nature of sports data.

As most experts will agree, not all passes are of equal difficulty, however, most traditional metrics count them as such. With our work we can quantify how well players can execute passes, assess their risk profile, and even compute completion probabilities for hypothetical passes by combining physical and machine learning models. Our model uses the first 0.4 seconds of a ball trajectory and the movement vectors of all players to predict the intended target of a pass with an accuracy of 93.0 % for successful and 72.0 % for unsuccessful passes much higher than any previously published work. Our extreme gradient boosting model can then quantify the likelihood of a successful pass completion towards the identified target with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.4 %.

This paper is concerned with uncovering a dangerous bias that is present in most of the approaches proposed in the literature that apply statistical techniques or machine learning models to study the correlation between team performances and match outcome. In particular, we find out that players’ behavior on a time interval is more and more correlated with the match outcome as the 90 minutes elapse. As an extreme example, we show that we can predict the output of a match with high confidence simply by looking at the last 15 minutes of the game. We call this effect elapsing-time bias. We conduct a quantitative analysis that proves the existence of this phenomenon and shows its consequences. We then propose a novel way to address the problem.

By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players.

In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies…. and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology: This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis: MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation. Complexity academic level: The case is written and designed for a graduate-level (MBA) class or an upper-level undergraduate class in areas such as contemporary issues in management, human resource management, talent management, strategic management, sports management and sports marketing. The case is suitable for courses that discuss strategy, talent management, human resource management and brand strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117343676"

One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115393426"

This paper reviews the literature to identify important attributes correlated with injuries and attempts to quantify their impact on player and team performance, using analytics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2010 up to 2020. It also provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) and DS techniques and algorithms used to study injuries. Additionally, it provides information for coaches, sports and health scientists, managers and decision makers to recognize the most common injuries and investigate possible injury patterns during competitions. We identify teams and players who suffered the most, and the type of injuries requiring more attention. We found a high impact from injuries and pathologies on performance; musculoskeletal impairments are the most common ones that lead to decreased performance. Finally, we conclude that there is a weak positive relationship between performance and injuries based on a holistic multivariate model that describes player and team performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101909590"

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24Â° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33Â° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user.

The main challenge in such recognition tasks is to learn the relationship between a group of individuals in a scene and its evolution over time. Recently, many techniques based on deep networks and graphical models have been proposed for group activity recognition. In this paper, we critically analyze the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for group activity recognition.

Towards addressing this problem, this paper presents ZeroNet, a system that shows the feasibility of developing ML models for IMU sensors with zero training overhead. ZeroNet harvests training data from publicly available videos for performing inferences on IMU. The difference in data among video and IMU domains introduces a number of challenges due to differences in sensor-camera coordinate systems, body sizes of users, speed/orientation changes during gesturing, sensor position variations etc. ZeroNet addresses these challenges by systematically extracting motion data from videos and transforming them into acceleration and orientation information measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, data-augmentation techniques are exploited that create synthetic variations in the harvested training data to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the ML models to user diversity. Evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 82.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 94.8% for recognition of 50 finger gestures thus indicating promise.

Hiring employees and contract renewals are instances of managerial decision-making problems that can incur high financial costs and long-term impacts on organizational performance. The primary goal of this study is to identify the Major League Baseball (MLB) free agents who are likely to receive a contract. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the design science research paradigm and the cognitive analytics management (CAM) theory to develop the research framework. A dataset on MLB's free agents between 2013 and 2017 was collected. A decision support tool was built using artificial neural networks. Findings: There are clear links between a player's statistical performance and the decision of the player to sign a new offered contract. “Age,” “Wins above Replacement” and “the team on which a player last played” are the most significant factors in determining if a player signs a new contract. Originality/value: This paper applied analytical modeling to personnel decision-making using the design science paradigm and guided by CAM as the kernel theory. The study employed machine learning techniques, producing a model that predicts the probability of free agents signing a new contract. Also, a web-based tool was developed to help decision-makers in baseball front offices so they can determine which available free agents to offer contracts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091776914"

Each player was characterized according to a set of 52 non-spatiotemporal descriptors including offensive, defensive and build-up variables that were computed from OPTA’s on-ball event records of the matches for 18 national leagues between the 2012 and 2019 seasons. To test whether positions could be identified from the statistical performance of the players, the dimensionality reduction techniques were used. To better understand the differences between the player positions, the most discriminatory variables for each group were obtained as a set of rules discovered by RIPPER, a machine learning algorithm. From the combination of both techniques, we obtained useful conclusions to enhance the performance of players and to identify positions on the field.

We provide the coach with a framework to predict the Maximum Mean Powers (MMPs) of a cyclist in an upcoming race based on the recently performed training sessions. This way the coach can experiment with several planned alternatives to figure out the best way for preparing the athlete for a race.

We show that the application of the hybrid model using XGBoost and CatBoost has clear advantages.

The most significant challenges in machine learning include class imbalance and high dimensionality problems. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and observed that both the issues have been studied independently. We found that feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of relevant features, while data sampling seeks to make the data more balanced by adding or removing instances. We also found out that efforts have been taken for studying the effect of the joint use of feature selection and balancing techniques. However, the prioritization of the feature selection and sampling is still difficult, and the relationship between them remains unclear. This paper presents a large-scale comparison of characterizing football players into nine positions by using FIFA video game data, whereas most of the previous studies in this field have focused on characterizing players into only three classes according to their positions. The proposed methodology for the study consists of three main steps. In the first step, the sampling technique is applied to deal with class imbalance, while the second step encompasses the feature selection technique, which deals with the high dimensionality problem. The third step combines feature selection and data sampling to deal with both the issues. We made the comparisons based on nine feature selection algorithms and three balancing techniques, and then we evaluated their performance using the random forest classifier. We found that 1) feature selection techniques did not improve the accuracy of the baseline model, 2) balancing techniques improved the accuracy compared to the baseline, and 3) the results showed superiority of the proposed methodology, involving the joint application of resampling and feature selection with data balanced by the random oversampling (ROS) method and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), compared to the results obtained only through the use of a single technique and from the original imbalanced training set. Overall, the proposed methodology improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the methodology provided a significant decrease in the number of features, from 29 to 10 features on average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118603993"

These days, sports analytics identify the patterns in the performance and highlight strengths and weaknesses of potential players. Sports analytics not only predict the performance of players in the near future but it also performs predictive modeling for a particular behavior of a player in the past.

This study has employed a two-stage feature sub-set retrieving technique to achieve this goal: we first considered three well-established feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded), and then, a feature sub-set was extracted using a Boolean process-based common “True” condition from these three algorithms. To justify the comparative accuracy and define the best predictive analytics, the well-known random forest, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost model have been considered. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been considered as the benchmark for further comparison with all features. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the XGBoost Classifier integrated with the wrapper methods offers precise prediction results for cardiovascular disease. The proposed approach can also be applied in other domains such as sports analytics, bio-informatics, and financial analysis in contrast with healthcare informatics.

Players' dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports. Supervised algorithms were used to illustrate the value of data and machine learning models in athletic development programs. Future research direction and challenges are discussed to implement the proposed ""Sports Ed 3.5""model for Philippine schools and universities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104188016"

Modality refers to how something happens or is experienced. Multimodal datasets are beneficial for solving complex research problems with AI methods. Kayaking technique optimization has been challenging, as there seems to be no gold standard for effective paddling techniques since there are outstanding athletes with profoundly different physical capabilities and kayaking styles. Multimodal analysis can help find the most effective paddling techniques for training and competition based on individuals' abilities. We describe the characteristics of the output power of kayak athletes and Electromyogram (EMG) measurements collected from the most critical muscles, and the relationship between these modalities. We propose metrics (weighted arithmetic mean difference and variability of power output and stroke duration) suitable for discerning athletes based on how efficiently and correctly they perform particular training tasks. Additionally, the described methods (asymmetry, coactivation, muscle intensity-output power) help athletes and coaches in assessing their performance and compare it with others based on their EMG activities.

The major goal in sport analytics applications is to make informed decisions to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse and predict lineup performance in basketball which may assist the team managers and coaches to make informed decisions. The constant lineup change in basketball games makes it vital to always have the best move ready at every moment of the game. A complex decision-making system is very important for the coaches to navigate their team through a season. This system must make the decisions based on the pros and cons of the teams, past results and lineups, and both teams’ performance under similar situations. To create this system, authors have constructed a signed, directed, and weighted network from the results of all matchups and lineups of the teams in NBA from 2007 to 2019. The proposed approach uses machine learning and graph theory to develop a new metric called Inverse Square Metric and edge-centric multi-view networks to predict the performance of a lineup in a given situation. The edge-centric approach provides a deep analysis of any condition between two teams from 16 different perspectives. The average accuracy achieved by ISM and edge-centric multi-view is 68% and 80%, respectively. In the end, the training and test datasets are chosen from different seasons and results are reasonable compared to the baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089844314"

Traditionally, they are treated separately and studied by two independent communities. However, this is not the intuitive way how humans interpret the matches: we predict the match results with the competition carrying on, and simultaneously evaluate each action based on the game context and its downstream impact. Predicting the match outcomes and evaluating the actions are coupled tasks, and the more accurately we predict, the better the evaluation is To this end, we develop a unified Match Tracing framework (namely, MT), for tackling the win prediction and performance evaluation jointly. The main idea of MT is to learn a real-time look-ahead win rate curve rather than a single scalar (win or lose). And the value of an action can be objectively measured with respect to the increase or decrease of the curve. To meet the low-latency restrictions of the online deployments, an efficient model equipped with recurrent attention mechanism and matrix perturbation (i.e., MT-Net) is built for learning and yielding the win rate curve. MT-Net encodes the players' behavior sequence through an attention mechanism and captures the player-interaction effects through a graph embedding method. With the action values derived from the win rate curve, performance can be quantified at different granularities (action/player/match level) by integrated analysis. Experiments on an e-sport game demonstrate the prediction effectiveness and the feasibility of the MT framework. Furthermore, we present the detailed application cases of MT, including key actions recognition and close match detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095863405"

The objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements, especially living in the Big Data World. The NBA Draft Position case study was demonstrated to present this novel “STEAMS” concept as compared to the current “STEM” or” STEAM” approach. There are three core visions of this “STEAMS” methodology: (1) replace “Art” with “Artificial Intelligence”, (2) separate “Statistics” from “Math”, and (3) integrate all six “STEAMS” elements. Adding the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions. Due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements is becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern Big Data era. Several techniques are used to help determine the NBA Player position and identify the similar NBA players for the benchmarking objective.

This paper focuses on data-driven defensive strategy learning in basketball. Most research to date on basketball strategylearning has focused on offensive effectiveness and is based on the interaction between the on-ball player and principleon-ball defender, thereby ignoring the contribution of the remaining players. Furthermore, most sports analytical systems that provide play-by-play data is heavily biased towards offensive metrics such as passes, dribbles, and shots. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning to classify the different defensive strategies basketball players adopt when deviating from their initial defensive action. An analytical model was developed to recognise the one-on-one (matched) relationships of the players, which is utilised to automatically identify any change of defensive strategy. A classification model is developed based on a player and ball tracking dataset from National Basketball Association (NBA) game play to classify the adopted defensive strategy against pick-and-roll play. The methodology described is the first toanalyse the defensive strategy of all in-game players (both on-ball players and off-ball players). The cross-validation results indicate that the proposed technique for automatic defensive strategy identification can achieve up to 69% accuracy of classification. Machine learning techniques, such as the one adopted here, have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of player decision making and defensive game strategies in basketball and other sports, by leveraging the player and ball tracking data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079221748"
