Abstract = {BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are
   transforming sports sciences by enabling precise performance analysis,
   injury prevention, and rehabilitation. However, inconsistencies in
   protocols, lack of standardization, and practical deployment challenges
   limit their real-world impact.MethodologyThis PRISMA-guided systematic
   review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021235527). Literature
   searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for
   studies published between 2018 and 2024. The PICO framework guided
   selection, and methodological quality was assessed using
   AMSTAR-2.ResultsA total of 40 studies were included. CNNs (n = 18;
   accuracy = 96 +/- 1.5\%) and LSTMs (n = 10; 92 +/- 2\%) performed best
   for motion tracking and gait analysis. SVMs (n = 17; 81 +/- 3\%) and RFs
   (n = 16; 80 +/- 2.8\%) were widely used in EMG, GPS, and workload
   analysis. Real-time feedback (n = 18) showed latency below 100 ms but
   was mainly validated in controlled settings; only 25\% tested systems
   outdoors. Wearable sensors (e.g., IMUs, gyroscopes) were used in 34
   studies, most frequently on the lower limbs. Participants averaged 42
   +/- 28 in number, with a bias toward young, healthy males. Key
   limitations included algorithm opacity, small homogeneous samples,
   inconsistent sensor setups, and limited interpretability or clinical
   integration.ConclusionAI/ML tools show high accuracy and responsiveness
   for biomechanical monitoring, injury risk detection, and training
   adaptation. However, scalability remains hindered by technical,
   demographic, and practical barriers. Future studies must prioritize
   diverse populations, standardize sensor and data protocols, emphasize
   model explainability, and ensure deployment in real-world sports
   environments to close the gap between algorithmic performance and
   applied utility.Trial registrationCRD42021235527},

Abstract = {Aim: This scoping review examines the application of artificial
   intelligence (AI) in sports biomechanics, with a focus on enhancing
   performance and preventing injuries. The review addresses key research
   questions, including primary AI methods, their effectiveness in
   improving athletic performance, their potential for injury prediction,
   sport-specific applications, strategies for translating knowledge,
   ethical considerations, and remaining research gaps. Following the
   PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted
   across five databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore,
   Scopus, and SPORTDiscus), encompassing studies published between January
   2015 and December 2024. After screening 3248 articles, 73 studies met
   the inclusion criteria (Cohen's kappa = 0.84). Data were collected on AI
   techniques, biomechanical parameters, performance metrics, and
   implementation details. Results revealed a shift from traditional
   statistical models to advanced machine learning methods. Based on
   moderate-quality evidence from 12 studies, convolutional neural networks
   reached 94\% agreement with international experts in technique
   assessment. Computer vision demonstrated accuracy within 15 mm compared
   to marker-based systems (6 studies, moderate quality). AI-driven
   training plans showed 25\% accuracy improvements (4 studies, limited
   evidence). Random forest models predicted hamstring injuries with 85\%
   accuracy (3 studies, moderate quality). Learning management systems
   enhanced knowledge transfer, raising coaches' understanding by 45\% and
   athlete adherence by 3.4 times. Implementing integrated AI systems
   resulted in a 23\% reduction in reinjury rates. However, significant
   challenges remain, including standardizing data, improving model
   interpretability, validating models in real-world settings, and
   integrating them into coaching routines. In summary, incorporating AI
   into sports biomechanics marks a groundbreaking advancement, providing
   analytical capabilities that surpass traditional techniques. Future
   research should focus on creating explainable AI, applying rigorous
   validation methods, handling data ethically, and ensuring equitable
   access to promote the widespread and responsible use of AI across all
   levels of competitive sports.},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is changing the way health care is practiced and
   recent applications of these novel statistical techniques have started
   to impact orthopaedic sports medicine. Machine learning enables the
   analysis of large volumes of data to establish complex relationships
   between ``input{''} and ``output{''} variables. These relationships may
   be more complex than could be established through traditional
   statistical analysis and can lead to the ability to predict the
   ``output{''} with high levels of accuracy. Supervised learning is the
   most common ML approach for healthcare data and recent studies have
   developed algorithms to predict patient-specific outcome after surgical
   procedures such as hip arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction. Deep learning is a higher-level ML approach that
   facilitates the processing and interpretation of complex datasets
   through artificial neural networks that are inspired by the way the
   human brain processes information. In orthopaedic sports medicine, deep
   learning has primarily been used for automatic image (computer vision)
   and text (natural language processing) interpretation. While
   applications in orthopaedic sports medicine have been increasing
   exponentially, one significant barrier to widespread adoption of ML
   remains clinician unfamiliarity with the associated methods and
   concepts. The goal of this review is to introduce these concepts, review
   current machine learning models in orthopaedic sport medicine, and
   discuss future opportunities for innovation within the specialty.},

   Review},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and its subcategories of machine learning and
   deep learning are gaining increasing importance and attention in the
   context of sports research. This has also meant that the number of
   corresponding publications has become complex and unmanageably large in
   human terms. In the current state of the research field, there is a lack
   of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining
   insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the
   present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the
   conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary
   trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the
   research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus
   database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected.
   Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R
   package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and
   research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing
   exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52\% of the
   total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64\% of
   all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are
   present, along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual
   institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the
   USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized
   using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of
   biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and
   learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports
   pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a
   subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand
   knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of
   research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports,
   and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps
   in the research.},

Title = {An Overview of Machine Learning Applications in Sports Injury Prediction},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Use injuries, i.e., injuries caused by repetitive strain on the body,
   represent a serious problem in athletics that has traditionally relied
   on historic datasets and human experience for prevention. Existing
   methodologies have been frustratingly slow at developing higher
   precision prevention practices. Technological advancements have
   permitted the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning
   (ML) as promising toolsets to enhance both injury mitigation and
   rehabilitation protocols. This article provides a comprehensive overview
   of recent advances in ML techniques as they have been applied to sports
   injury prediction and prevention. A comprehensive literature review was
   conducted searching PubMed/Medline, Institute of Electrical and
   Electronics Engineers (IEEE)/Institute of Engineering and Technology
   (IET), and ScienceDirect. Ovid Discovery and Google Scholar were used to
   provide additional aggregate results and a grey literature search. A
   focus was placed on papers published from 2017 to 2022. Algorithms of
   interest were limited to K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-means, decision
   tree, random forest, gradient boosting and AdaBoost, and neural
   networks. A total of 42 original research papers were included, and
   their results were summarized. We conclude that given the current lack
   of open source, uniform data sets, as well as a reliance on dated
   regression models, no strong conclusions about the real world efficacy
   of ML as it applies to sports injury prediction can be made. However, it
   is suggested that addressing these two issues will allow powerful, novel
   ML architectures to be deployed, thus rapidly advancing the state of
   this field, and providing validated clinical tools.},

Journal = {WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},

Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning describe a broad range
   of algorithm types that can be trained based on datasets to make
   predictions. The increasing sophistication of AI has created new
   opportunities to apply these algorithms within within trauma care. Our
   paper overviews the current uses of AI along the continuum of trauma
   care, including injury prediction, triage, emergency department volume,
   assessment, and outcomes. Starting at the point of injury, algorithms
   are being used to predict severity of motor vehicle crashes, which can
   help inform emergency responses. Once on the scene, AI can be used to
   help emergency services triage patients remotely in order to inform
   transfer location and urgency. For the receiving hospital, these tools
   can be used to predict trauma volumes in the emergency department to
   help allocate appropriate staffing. After patient arrival to hospital,
   these algorithms not only can help to predict injury severity, which can
   inform decision-making, but also predict patient outcomes to help trauma
   teams anticipate patient trajectory. Overall, these tools have the
   capability to transform trauma care. AI is still nascent within the
   trauma surgery sphere, but this body of the literature shows that this
   technology has vast potential. AI-based predictive tools in trauma need
   to be explored further through prospective trials and clinical
   validation of algorithms.},

Abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the application of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in sports performance analysis. Sixteen
   peer-reviewed studies spanning 13 distinct sports disciplines were
   included, employing a variety of AI techniques-from classical machine
   learning algorithms to advanced deep learning and computer vision
   models. Methods applied encompassed Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, reinforcement learning,
   and predictive modeling architectures. The pooled average classification
   accuracy was 87.78\% (95\% CI: 82.66-92.90), although substantial
   heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2 = 93.75\%). Computer
   vision and deep learning-based approaches were associated with higher
   performance metrics in several studies, particularly in
   movement-intensive sports such as tennis and basketball. Nevertheless,
   several challenges were identified, including lack of standardization in
   model evaluation, limited algorithmic transparency, and difficulties in
   generalizing findings from controlled laboratory environments to
   real-world competitive settings. The results underscore the promising
   role of AI in optimizing training protocols, supporting tactical

   Intelligence: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {NURSING REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Background/Objetives: Pressure injuries pose a significant challenge in
   healthcare, adversely impacting individuals' quality of life and
   healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units. The effective
   identification of at-risk individuals is crucial, but traditional scales
   have limitations, prompting the development of new tools. Artificial
   intelligence offers a promising approach to identifying and preventing
   pressure injuries in critical care settings. This review aimed to assess
   the extent of the literature regarding the use of artificial
   intelligence technologies in the prediction of pressure injuries in
   critically ill patients in intensive care units to identify gaps in
   current knowledge and direct future research. Methods: The review
   followed the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews,
   and the study protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science
   Framework platform. Results: This review included 14 studies, primarily
   highlighting the use of machine learning models trained on electronic
   health records data for predicting pressure injuries. Between 6 and 86
   variables were used to train these models. Only two studies reported the
   clinical deployment of these models, reporting results such as reduced
   nursing workload, decreased prevalence of hospital-acquired pressure
   injuries, and decreased intensive care unit length of stay. Conclusions:
   Artificial intelligence technologies present themselves as a dynamic and
   innovative approach, with the ability to identify risk factors and
   predict pressure injuries effectively and promptly. This review
   synthesizes information about the use of these technologies and guides
   future directions and motivations.},

Abstract = {Background: Technological innovation is a key component of orthopaedic
   surgery. With the integration of powerful technologies in surgery and
   clinical practice, artificial intelligence (AI) may become an important
   tool for orthopaedic surgeons in the future. Through adaptive learning
   and problem solving that serve to constantly increase accuracy, machine
   learning algorithms show great promise in orthopaedics. Purpose: To
   investigate the current and potential uses of AI in the management of
   anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Study Design: Systematic
   review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A systematic review of the
   PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus databases
   between their start and August 12, 2020, was performed by 2 independent
   reviewers. Inclusion criteria included application of AI anywhere along
   the spectrum of predicting, diagnosing, and managing ACL injuries.
   Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, conference
   abstracts, review articles, and meta-analyses. Statistical analysis
   could not be performed because of data heterogeneity; therefore, a
   descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results: A total of 19 publications
   were included after screening. Applications were divided based on the
   different stages of the clinical course in ACL injury: prediction (n =
   2), diagnosis (n = 12), intraoperative application (n = 1), and
   postoperative care and rehabilitation (n = 4). AI-based technologies
   were used in a wide variety of applications, including image
   interpretation, automated chart review, assistance in the physical
   examination via optical tracking using infrared cameras or
   electromagnetic sensors, generation of predictive models, and
   optimization of postoperative care and rehabilitation. Conclusion: There
   is an increasing interest in AI among orthopaedic surgeons, as reflected
   by the applications for ACL injury presented in this review. Although
   some studies showed similar or better outcomes using AI compared with
   traditional techniques, many challenges need to be addressed before this
   technology is ready for widespread use.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted across many
   domains such as transport, healthcare, defence and sport, with football
   codes no exception. Though there is a range of potential benefits of AI,
   concern has also been expressed regarding potential risks. An important
   first step in ensuring that AI applications in football are usable,
   beneficial, safe and ethical is to understand the current range of
   applications, the AI models adopted and their proposed functions. This
   systematic review aimed to identify different applications of AI across
   football codes to synthesise current knowledge and determine whether
   potential risks are being considered. The systematic review included 190
   peer-reviewed articles. Nine areas of application were found ranging
   from athlete evaluation and event detection to match outcome prediction
   and injury detection and prediction. In total, 27 different AI models
   were identified, with artificial neural networks the most frequently
   applied. Five AI assessment metrics were identified including
   specificity, recall, precision, accuracy and F1-score. Four potential
   risks were identified, concerning data security, usability, data biases
   and inappropriate athlete load management. It is concluded that, though

Title = {Ethical implications of artificial intelligence in sport: A systematic
   scoping review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPORT AND HEALTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Although there is growing evidence of the use of artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques in sports, ethical issues surrounding AI
   use are being discussed at a minimal level. Thus, this systematic
   scoping review aimed to summarize the current ethical implications
   associated with using AI in sports. Methods: In this study, a total of 9
   databases-MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, EBSCOhost,
   IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar-were searched.
   The review protocol was registered (https://osf.io/42a8q) before
   extracting data. The search yielded 397 studies, and 25 studies met the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The 25 studies were
   categorized into 4 primary ethical concerns: fairness and bias,
   transparency and explainability, privacy and data ethics, and
   accountability in AI's application in sports. These categorizations were
   derived based on the systematic review of ethical issues highlighted
   across the selected studies. Fifteen studies delved into fairness and
   bias, focusing on how AI can perpetuate existing inequalities in sports.
   Thirteen studies addressed the lack of transparency, emphasizing the
   challenges in interpretability and trust in AI-driven decisions. Privacy
   and data ethics emerged as significant in 22 studies, highlighting risks
   related to the misuse of athletes' sensitive data. Finally,
   accountability was examined in 8 studies, stressing the ethical
   obligations of AI developers and users in sports contexts. The thematic
   analysis revealed overlapping concerns, as some studies addressed
   multiple issues simultaneously. Conclusion: Future research should focus
   on developing ethical frameworks tailored to underrepresented sports
   contexts and creating global standards for AI regulation in sports. This
   includes investigating the implications of AI applications in amateur
   sports, enhancing diversity in AI training datasets, and exploring the
   integration of ethical AI practices across various sports governance
   structures.},

   systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ORTHOPAEDICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Purpose Injuries are common in sports and can have significant physical,
   psychological and financial consequences. Machine learning (ML) methods
   could be used to improve injury prediction and allow proper approaches
   to injury prevention. The aim of our study was therefore to perform a
   systematic review of ML methods in sport injury prediction and
   prevention. Methods A search of the PubMed database was performed on
   March 24th 2020. Eligible articles included original studies
   investigating the role of ML for sport injury prediction and prevention.
   Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, risk
   of bias and extracted data. Methodological quality and risk of bias were
   determined by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Study quality was evaluated
   using the GRADE working group methodology. Results Eleven out of 249
   studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Different ML methods were used
   (tree-based ensemble methods (n = 9), Support Vector Machines (n = 4),
   Artificial Neural Networks (n = 2)). The classification methods were
   facilitated by preprocessing steps (n = 5) and optimized using over- and
   undersampling methods (n = 6), hyperparameter tuning (n = 4), feature
   selection (n = 3) and dimensionality reduction (n = 1). Injury
   predictive performance ranged from poor (Accuracy = 52\%, AUC = 0.52) to
   strong (AUC = 0.87, f1-score = 85\%). Conclusions Current ML methods can
   be used to identify athletes at high injury risk and be helpful to
   detect the most important injury risk factors. Methodological quality of
   the analyses was sufficient in general, but could be further improved.
   More effort should be put in the interpretation of the ML models.},

Abstract = {The increase in the volume of structured and unstructured data related
   to more than just sport events leads to the development and increased
   use of techniques that extract information and employ machine-learning
   algorithms in predicting process outcomes based on input but not
   necessarily output data. Taking sports into consideration, predicting
   outcomes, and extracting valuable information has become appealing not
   only to sports workers but also to the wider audience, particularly in
   the areas of team management and sports betting. The aim of this article
   is to review the existing machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting
   sport outcomes. Over 100 papers were analyzed and only some of these
   papers were taken into consideration. Almost all of the analyzed papers
   use some sort of feature selection and feature extraction, most often
   prior to using the machine-learning algorithm. As an evaluation method
   of ML algorithms, researchers, in most cases, use data segmentation with
   data being chronologically distributed. In addition to data
   segmentation, researchers also use thek-cross-evaluation method. Sport
   predictions are usually treated as a classification problem with one
   class being predicted and rare cases being predicted as numerical
   values. Mostly used ML models are neural networks using data
   segmentation. This article is categorized under: Technologies > Machine

Abstract = {Background An increasing number of musculoskeletal injury prediction
   models are being developed and implemented in sports medicine.
   Prediction model quality needs to be evaluated so clinicians can be
   informed of their potential usefulness. Objective To evaluate the
   methodological conduct and completeness of reporting of musculoskeletal
   injury prediction models in sport. Methods A systematic review was
   performed from inception to June 2021. Studies were included if they:
   (1) predicted sport injury; (2) used regression, machine learning, or
   deep learning models; (3) were written in English; (4) were peer
   reviewed. Results Thirty studies (204 models) were included; 60\% of
   studies utilized only regression methods, 13\% only machine learning,
   and 27\% both regression and machine learning approaches. All studies
   developed a prediction model and no studies externally validated a
   prediction model. Two percent of models (7\% of studies) were low risk
   of bias and 98\% of models (93\% of studies) were high or unclear risk
   of bias. Three studies (10\%) performed an a priori sample size
   calculation; 14 (47\%) performed internal validation. Nineteen studies
   (63\%) reported discrimination and two (7\%) reported calibration. Four
   studies (13\%) reported model equations for statistical predictions and
   no machine learning studies reported code or hyperparameters. Conclusion
   Existing sport musculoskeletal injury prediction models were poorly
   developed and have a high risk of bias. No models could be recommended
   for use in practice. The majority of models were developed with small
   sample sizes, had inadequate assessment of model performance, and were
   poorly reported. To create clinically useful sports musculoskeletal
   injury prediction models, considerable improvements in methodology and
   reporting are urgently required.},

Abstract = {Despite advancements in medical care, acute kidney injury (AKI) remains
   a major contributor to adverse patient outcomes and presents a
   significant challenge due to its associated morbidity, mortality, and
   financial cost. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being recognized
   for its potential to transform AKI care by enabling early prediction,
   detection, and facilitating an individualized approach to patient
   management. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis
   of externally validated ML models for the prediction, detection, and
   management of AKI. We systematically searched for relevant literature
   from inception to 15 February 2024, using four databases-MEDLINE,
   EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus. We focused solely on models that had
   undergone external validation, employed Kidney Disease Improving Global
   Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions for AKI, and utilized ML models (excluding
   logistic regression models). A total of 44 studies encompassing 161 ML
   models for AKI prediction, severity assessment, and outcomes in both
   adult and pediatric populations were included in the review. These
   studies encompassed 4,153,424 patient admissions, with 1,209,659 in the
   development and internal validation cohorts and 2,943,765 in the
   external validation cohorts. The ML models demonstrated significant
   variability in performance owing to differing clinical settings,
   populations, and predictors used. Most of the included models were
   developed in specialized patient populations, such as those in intensive
   care units, post-surgical settings, and specific disease states (e.g.
   congestive heart failure, traumatic brain injury, etc.). Moreover, only
   a few models incorporated dynamic predictors of AKI which are crucial
   for improving clinical utility in rapidly evolving clinical conditions
   like AKI. The variable performance of these models when applied to
   external validation cohorts highlights the challenges of reproducibility
   and generalizability in implementing ML models in AKI care. Despite
   acceptable performance metrics, none of the models assessed in this
   review underwent validation or implementation in real-world clinical
   workflows. These findings underscore the need for standardized
   performance metrics and validation protocols to enhance the
   generalizability and clinical applicability of these models. Future
   efforts should focus on enhancing model adaptability by incorporating
   dynamic predictors and unstructured data and by ensuring that models are
   developed in diverse patient populations. Moreover, collaboration
   between clinicians and data scientists is critical to ensure the
   development of models that are clinically relevant, fair, and tailored
   to real-world healthcare environments.},

   Current Evidence and Future Directions},
Journal = {SPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Musculoskeletal injury (MSI) risk screening has gained significant
   attention in rehabilitation, sports, and fitness due to its ability to
   predict injuries and guide preventive interventions. This review
   analyzes the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and the Y-Balance Test
   (YBT) landscape. Although these instruments are widely used because of
   their simplicity and ease of access, their accuracy in predicting
   injuries is inconsistent. Significant issues include reliance on broad
   scoring systems, varying contextual relevance, and neglecting individual
   characteristics such as age, gender, fitness levels, and past injuries.
   Meta-analyses reveal that the FMS and YBT overall scores often lack
   clinical relevance, exhibiting significant variability in sensitivity
   and specificity among different groups. Findings support the
   effectiveness of multifactorial models that consider modifiable and
   non-modifiable risk factors such as workload ratios, injury history, and
   fitness data for better prediction outcomes. Advances in machine
   learning (ML) and wearable technology, including inertial measurement
   units (IMUs) and intelligent monitoring systems, show promise by
   capturing dynamic and personalized high-dimensional data. Such
   approaches enhance our understanding of how biomechanical,
   physiological, and contextual injury aspects interact. This review
   discusses the problems of conventional movement screens, highlights the
   necessity for workload monitoring and personalized evaluations, and
   promotes the integration of technology-driven and data-centered
   techniques. Adopting tailored, multifactorial models could significantly
   improve injury prediction and prevention across varied populations.
   Future research should refine these models to enhance their practical
   use in clinical and field environments.},

Abstract = {This systematic review examines recent statistical methodologies for
   assessing cricket player performance across batting, bowling, and
   fielding. Traditional metrics such as batting averages, runs scored, and
   wickets taken often fail to capture a player's comprehensive
   contribution to the game. Recent approaches, however, employ advanced
   statistical techniques including Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA),
   Generalized Geometric Distributions (GGD), Bayesian methods, copula
   functions, and machine learning algorithms, to develop novel performance
   indices. These methods incorporate contextual factors like opposition
   quality, pitch conditions, and match situations, offering a better
   evaluation, particularly in fast-paced formats like T20 cricket. The
   review emphasizes the integration of metrics across all skill areas to
   achieve an overall assessment, highlighting the significance of opening
   partnerships, high-pressure bowling performances, and fielding
   efficiency in determining match outcomes. It also discusses the growing
   utilization of real-time data and sophisticated analytics in strategic
   decision-making and player selection. However, challenges remain such as
   the difficulty in collecting detailed performance data, particularly for
   fielding actions, and considering psychological factors like how
   different players handle pressure. The review concludes by underscoring
   the need for future research to improve evaluation methods, include more
   detailed data, and integrate psychological dimensions. As cricket
   analytics continue to evolve, embracing these new approaches will help
   teams make better use of data, leading to improved strategies, player
   performance, and a deeper understanding of the game.},

   and herb-induced liver injury: A review},
Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {New approach methods (NAMs) have been developed to predict a wide range
   of toxicities through innovative technologies. Liver injury is one of
   the most extensively studied endpoints due to its severity and
   frequency, occurring among populations that consume drugs or dietary
   supplements. In this review, we focus on recent developments of in
   silico modeling for liver injury prediction using deep learning and in
   vitro data based on adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Despite these
   models being mainly developed using datasets generated from drug-like
   molecules, they were also applied to the prediction of hepatotoxicity
   caused by herbal products. As deep learning has achieved great success
   in many different fields, advanced machine learning algorithms have been
   actively applied to improve the accuracy of in silico models.
   Additionally, the development of liver AOPs, combined with big data in
   toxicology, has been valuable in developing in silico models with
   enhanced predictive performance and interpretability. Specifically, one
   approach involves developing structure-based models for predicting
   molecular initiating events of liver AOPs, while others use in vitro
   data with structure information as model inputs for making predictions.
   Even though liver injury remains a difficult endpoint to predict,
   advancements in machine learning algorithms and the expansion of in
   vitro databases with relevant biological knowledge have made a huge
   impact on improving in silico modeling for drug-induced liver injury
   prediction.},

   mass and height), followed by player profile (most commonly, age
   followed by position). The most common machine learning technique for
   data processing was the decision tree, followed by logistic regression.
   The median AUC of the best performing models indicated per study was
   0.75 (0.16), median sensitivity/recall was 0.78 (0.15), median
   specificity was 0.81 (0.27), and median precision was 0.53 (0.13). The
   performance of prediction models in the literature has been poor, caused
   by a fundamental difficulty in discovering real effects in small sample
   sizes with low injury rates. A better understanding of how training and
   game exposure is associated with the data components for data
   pre-processing and ultimately associated with injury is vital for the
   future development of robust injury prediction models.},

Title = {Wearable Sensor Technology to Predict Core Body Temperature: A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Heat-related illnesses, which range from heat exhaustion to heatstroke,
   affect thousands of individuals worldwide every year and are
   characterized by extreme hyperthermia with the core body temperature
   (CBT) usually > 40 degrees C, decline in physical and athletic
   performance, CNS dysfunction, and, eventually, multiorgan failure. The
   measurement of CBT has been shown to predict heat-related illness and
   its severity, but the current measurement methods are not practical for
   use in high acuity and high motion settings due to their invasive and
   obstructive nature or excessive costs. Noninvasive predictions of CBT
   using wearable technology and predictive algorithms offer the potential
   for continuous CBT monitoring and early intervention to prevent HRI in
   athletic, military, and intense work environments. Thus far, there has
   been a lack of peer-reviewed literature assessing the efficacy of
   wearable devices and predictive analytics to predict CBT to mitigate
   heat-related illness. This systematic review identified 20 studies
   representing a total of 25 distinct algorithms to predict the core body
   temperature using wearable technology. While a high accuracy in
   prediction was noted, with 17 out of 18 algorithms meeting the clinical
   validity standards. few algorithms incorporated individual and
   environmental data into their core body temperature prediction
   algorithms, despite the known impact of individual health and
   situational and environmental factors on CBT. Robust machine learning
   methods offer the ability to develop more accurate, reliable, and
   personalized CBT prediction algorithms using wearable devices by
   including additional data on user characteristics, workout intensity,
   and the surrounding environment. The integration and interoperability of
   CBT prediction algorithms with existing heat-related illness prevention
   and treatment tools, including heat indices such as the WBGT, athlete
   management systems, and electronic medical records, will further prevent
   HRI and increase the availability and speed of data access during
   critical heat events, improving the clinical decision-making process for
   athletic trainers and physicians, sports scientists, employers, and
   military officers.},

   Stories and Challenges},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in elite
   sports. We approach the topic from two perspectives. Firstly, we provide
   a literature based overview of AI success stories in areas other than
   sports. We identified multiple approaches in the area of Machine
   Perception, Machine Learning and Modeling, Planning and Optimization as
   well as Interaction and Intervention, holding a potential for improving
   training and competition. Secondly, we discover the present status of AI
   use in elite sports. Therefore, in addition to another literature
   review, we interviewed leading sports scientist, which are closely
   connected to the main national service institute for elite sports in
   their countries. The analysis of this literature review and the
   interviews show that the most activity is carried out in the methodical
   categories of signal and image processing. However, projects in the
   field of modeling \& planning have become increasingly popular within
   the last years. Based on these two perspectives, we extract deficits,
   issues and opportunities and summarize them in six key challenges faced
   by the sports analytics community. These challenges include data
   collection, controllability of an AI by the practitioners and
   explainability of AI results.},

   Injury Risk Prediction Methods},
Journal = {DIAGNOSTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the transformative role
   of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting and preventing sports
   injuries across various disciplines. By exploring the application of
   machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, such as random
   forests (RFs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), this review highlights AI's ability to analyze
   complex datasets, detect patterns, and generate predictive insights that
   enhance injury prevention strategies. AI models improve the accuracy and
   reliability of injury risk assessments by tailoring prevention
   strategies to individual athlete profiles and processing real-time data.
   A literature review was conducted through searches in PubMed, Google
   Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from
   2014 to 2024 and using keywords such as `artificial intelligence',
   `machine learning', `sports injury', and `risk prediction'. While AI's
   predictive power supports both team and individual sports, its
   effectiveness varies based on the unique data requirements and injury
   risks of each, with team sports presenting additional complexity in data
   integration and injury tracking across multiple players. This review
   also addresses critical issues such as data quality, ethical concerns,
   privacy, and the need for transparency in AI applications. By shifting
   the focus from reactive to proactive injury management, AI technologies
   contribute to enhanced athlete safety, optimized performance, and
   reduced human error in medical decisions. As AI continues to evolve, its
   potential to revolutionize sports injury prediction and prevention
   promises further advancements in athlete health and performance while
   addressing current challenges.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of machine
   learning-based sports analytics in baseball. This review is primarily
   guided by the following three research questions: (1) What baseball
   analytics problems have been studied using machine learning? (2) What
   data repositories have been used? (3) What and how machine learning
   techniques have been employed for these studies? The findings of these
   research questions lead to several research contributions. First, we
   provide a taxonomy for baseball analytics problems. According to the
   proposed taxonomy, machine learning has been employed to (1) predict
   individual game plays; (2) determine player performance; (3) estimate
   player valuation; (4) predict future player injuries; and (5) project
   future game outcomes. Second, we identify a set of data repositories for
   baseball analytics studies. The most popular data repositories are
   Baseball Savant and Baseball Reference. Third, we conduct an in-depth
   analysis of the machine learning models applied in baseball analytics.
   The most popular machine learning models are random forest and support
   vector machine. Furthermore, only a small fraction of studies have
   rigorously followed the best practices in data preprocessing, machine
   learning model training, testing, and prediction outcome interpretation.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of the Relationship between Workload and Injury Risk
   of Professional Male Soccer Players},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The number of studies on the relationship between training and
   competition load and injury has increased exponentially in recent years,
   and it is also widely studied by researchers in the field of
   professional soccer. In order to provide practical guidance for workload
   management and injury prevention in professional athletes, this study
   provides a review of the literature on the effect of load on injury
   risk, injury prediction, and interpretation mechanisms. The results of
   the research show that: (1) It appears that short-term fixture
   congestion may increase the match injury incidence, while long-term
   fixture congestion may have no effect on both the overall injury
   incidence and the match injury incidence. (2) It is impossible to
   determine conclusively whether any global positioning system
   (GPS)-derived metrics (total distance, high-speed running distance, and
   acceleration) are associated with an increased risk of injury. (3) The
   acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) of the session rating of perceived
   exertion (s-RPE) may be significantly associated with the risk of
   non-contact injuries, but an ACWR threshold with a minimum risk of
   injury could not be obtained. (4) Based on the workload and fatigue
   recovery factors, artificial intelligence technology may possess good
   predictive power regarding injury risk.},
