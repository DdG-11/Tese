In the particular and very topical case of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), police forensic investigations aim at evaluating whether a given impact or assault scenario led to the clinically observed TBI. This question is traditionally answered by means of forensic biomechanics and neurosurgical expertise which cannot provide a fully objective probabilistic measure. To this end, we propose here a numerical framework-based solution coupling biomechanical simulations of a variety of injurious impacts to machine learning training of police reports provided by the UK’s Thames Valley Police and the National Crime Agency’s National Injury Database. In this approach, the biomechanical predictions of mechanical metrics such as strain and stress distributions are interpreted by the machine learning model by additionally considering assault specific metadata to predict brain injury outcomes. The framework, only taking as input information typically available in police reports, reaches prediction accuracies exceeding 94% for skull fracture, 79% for loss of consciousness and intracranial haemorrhage, and is able to identify the best predictive features for each targeted injury. Overall, the proposed framework offers new avenues for the prediction, directly from police reports, of any TBI related symptom as required by forensic law enforcement investigations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219203109"

Hence, early recognition and prediction of ARDS are crucial for the timely administration of targeted treatment. However, ARDS is frequently underdiagnosed or delayed, and its heterogeneity diminishes the clinical utility of ARDS biomarkers. This study aimed to observe the incidence of ARDS among high-risk patients and develop and validate an ARDS prediction model using machine learning (ML) techniques based on clinical parameters. Methods: This prospective cohort study in China was conducted on critically ill patients to derivate and validate the prediction model. The derivation cohort, consisting of 400 patients admitted to the ICU of the Peking University Third Hospital(PUTH) between December 2020 and August 2023, was separated for training and internal validation, and an external data set of 160 patients at the FU YANG People's Hospital from August 2022 to August 2023 was employed for external validation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen predictor variables. Multiple ML classification models were integrated to analyze and identify the best models. Several evaluation indexes were used to compare the model performance, including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive ex Planations (SHAP) is used to interpret ML models. Results: 400 critically ill patients were included in the analysis, with 117 developing ARDS during follow-up. The final model included gender, Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS), Hepatic Disease, Shock, and combined Lung Contusion. Based on the AUC and DCA in the validation group, the logistic model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an AUC of 0.836 (95% CI: 0.762–0.910). For external validation, comprising 160 patients, 44 of whom developed ARDS, the AUC was 0.799 (95% CI: 0.723–0.875), significantly outperforming the LIPS score alone. Conclusion: Combining the LIPS score with other clinical parameters in a logistic regression model provides a more accurate, clinically applicable, and user-friendly ARDS prediction tool than the LIPS score alone. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215558049"

The analysis and modeling of basketball game data have long been central topics in sports analytics. In recent years, integrating machine learning techniques has facilitated significant advancements in predicting basketball game outcomes. However, most existing studies predominantly focus on NBA data, with relatively limited exploration of other leagues. To address this research gap, this study utilizes game data from the Chinese Basketball Association spanning the 2021–2024 seasons to develop predictive models. This research is the first to apply the classical Four Factors model and DefenseOfense model, along with their derivative versions (Four Factors detailed model and DefenseOfense detailed model), to the Chinese Men’s Professional Basketball League, providing a baseline for prediction. To ensure practical applicability of the models and enable their effective use in real-world scenarios, this study exclusively uses data available before the start of each game as feature variables for training. This approach ensures that the enhanced models can perform well in theoretical evaluations and provide reliable predictions when applied in practice. To evaluate model performance, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron with contrastive loss, and XGBoost are employed, with metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, and AUROC used for comparison. The results reveal that the incorporation of additional features substantially enhances predictive performance. In particular, under the Logistic Regression framework, the newly developed model based on the Four Factors detailed achieves an accuracy of 85.49%, representing the highest predictive performance among all the evaluated approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010155818"

By merging physiological signals i.e., Heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, muscle activation patterns, with psychological signals i.e., mental toughness, athlete engagement, group cohesion along with contextual training data, we create a hybrid model that performs superiorly as compared to traditional unidimensional models. Our exercisers were trained using a gradient boosting and neural network to learn the very complex non-linear relationships that exist between the physical and the psychological performance drivers. With a rich sample set of 480 athletes from different sports, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy (R2 = 0.90) in predicting performance outcomes and outdid the conventional methods with statistical approaches R2 = 0.77) and machine learning based methods (R2 = 0.77) And machine whiz methods. The robust results achieved from the model (over 90%) as compared to conventional nor statistical methods. From the analysis of the features’ importance, the strongest predictor of performance are the Provided Dedicated Athletes’ scores of the Functional Movement Screening (13.7%), athlete dedication (11.5%), maximum acceleration capabilities (10.2%), which verify the relationship along biomechanical, preconceived explosive power and psychological commitment. This reflects the finding whereby deep categorized athletic talent prediction requires a multi-dimensional approach by sophisticated fusion techniques. The framework is useful to coaches and sports scientists because it allows for the individualized design of injury risk mitigation and physiologically and psychologically-focused interpersonal help. This approach integrates multiple factors and constitutes an important progress in sports analytics by providing a comprehensive perspective on the complex realities which influence elite athletic performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004685126"

Baseball players are particularly susceptible to injuries, as players often compete in 5 to 7 games per week, placing continuous strain on their bodies. Among various injuries, Tommy John Surgery (TJS) poses a notable risk for Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. Traditional TJS prediction methods required sensors or video-based motion capture, which are impractical during actual games and limited in making predictions too close to the injuries, such as within 30 pitches. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that utilizes both classification and regression tasks. Using MLB pitching data (2016–2023), the classification model detects injury risk up to 100 days in advance with a high prediction performance of 0.73 F1-score, while the regression model estimates the time remaining until the player’s last pre-surgery game with R2 of 0.79. In addition, to enhance our model’s applicability, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence technique to analyze the impacting mechanical features, such as a lowered four-seam fastball release point, that accelerate UCL deterioration, increasing TJS risk. These findings provide a practical foundation for early intervention strategies, potentially preserving pitcher health and reducing the need for complex surgical procedures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002800559"

This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable predictive model employing machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately identify patients at high risk of acute liver injury within one month of initiating ICI treatment. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included pan-cancer patients who received their first ICI treatment between March 2019 and September 2022 at Zhongshan Hospital. Six ML algorithms, namely neural networks (NN), gradient boosting classifier (GBC), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), categorical boosting classifier (CatBoost) and random forest (RF), were utilized to construct predictive models for acute ICI-related liver injury. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and brier score (BS). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to rank the feature importance and interpret the final model, providing insights into the contribution of each feature to liver injury prediction, thereby enhancing clinical interpretability. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300067470). Results: A total of 863 patients were enrolled in the study, with 22.71% experiencing liver injury within one month of ICI initiation. Among the six preliminary models, the RF model exhibited the best performance and was selected for the development of the final model. The SHAP method was utilized to rank variables from the six pre-models, with 10 variables selected for the final model by identifying the intersection of the top 20 most important variables across these models. The final RF model exhibited robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73–0.90) on the test set, and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.88) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72–0.89) in the 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. The Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) curve illustrated solid clinical benefit, and the calibration curve reflected good predictive consistency. Conclusion: An interpretable RF model was developed to predict acute liver injury occurring within one month after ICI treatment. This clinical-friendly model enables early identification of high-risk patients, facilitating optimized clinical management and ultimately improving treatment outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009899417"

The current use of vision sensors for HSAR is a difficult task due to the intricate movements involved in sports and fitness workouts, as well as fluctuations in illumination conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) and their usage for human sports activities classification based on sensor data called ML-HSAR is presented in this article. A dataset containing 19 different human activities gathered from 8 different people through different types of sensors was used for this work; the dataset contains activities like sitting and standing, as well as other activities that require serious movements, such as running, cycling, and playing basketball. This study primarily aims to determine the performance of the considered ML models in accurately classifying these activities found in the dataset. The training of the algorithms and the subsequent evaluation were done on the segmented sensor data, effectively leveraging the dataset’s temporal aspect.

Despite notable advancements driven by deep learning approaches, BAR remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of basketball movements, frequent occlusions, and limited availability of standardized benchmark datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured synthesis of current developments in BAR research, encompassing four principal dimensions: dataset curation, computational methodologies, synthetic data generation, and model explainability. A critical analysis of publicly available basketball-specific datasets is presented, delineating their modalities, annotation strategies, action taxonomies, and representational scope. Furthermore, the survey offers a structured classification of state-of-the-art action recognition methodologies, ranging from video-based and skeleton-based models to sensor-driven and multimodal fusion approaches, emphasizing architectural characteristics, evaluation protocols, and task-specific adaptations. The role of synthetic data is systematically examined as a means to address data scarcity, reduce annotation noise, and enhance model generalization through controlled variability and simulation-based augmentation. In parallel, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques is also analyzed, with a focus on post-hoc attribution methods, probabilistic reasoning models, and interpretable neural architectures, aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of decision-making processes. The survey identifies persisting research challenges, including dataset heterogeneity, limitations in cross-domain transferability, and the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in deep models. By delineating current limitations and prospective directions, this work provides a foundational reference to guide the development of robust, generalizable, and explainable BAR systems for deployment in real-world sports intelligence applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012934994"

Preventive approaches should consider all of these factors to help identify at-risk individuals. Advanced machine-learning tools and artificial intelligence can be utilized for this purpose. This study aimed to develop an effective injury prediction model for lower-limb sports injuries. Methods: A total of 120 male university-level football, cricket, and basketball players underwent elaborate mental and physical screening, accounting for 44 variables. The injury details of the previous season were recorded. Using these data, different injury-predicting muscle-learning models were built, and their efficiencies were compared. Results: Thirty-eight injuries were recorded, 20 (52.6 %) of which corresponded to ankle injuries, nine to hamstring injuries (23.6 %), four to knee injuries (10.5 %), and five to foot injuries (13.3 %). Eight injuries occurred during the training phase, and 30 injuries occurred during the competition. Six players sustained the injuries twice. In this case, only the initial injury was considered. Finally, thirty-two injuries were used to construct the model. The model generated by the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm (KNN) with Random Oversampling (ROS) as an oversampling technique was found to be the best (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score = 0.87, true positive rate = 100 %, true negative rate = 62.5 %).

Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014950435"

Early detection and intervention are imperative to prevent further deterioration of the condition. This study proposes a prediction framework for ALI prediction based on the integration of kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) with a multi-strategy enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (TSPSO). TSPSO improves global search capability by incorporating advanced strategies into PSO, outperforming several PSO variants and rivaling top-tier algorithms such as LSHADE_cnEpSi on the IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark. Based on hematological data from a controlled murine ALI model, the developed bTSPSO-KELM achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of 91.43 %, sensitivity of 96.82 %, specificity of 82.49 %, precision of 90.40 %, Matthews correlation coefficient of 81.80 %, and an F-measure of 93.43 %.

However, studies developing injury prediction models without relying on expensive tools such as GPS remain limited. This study aimed to develop an explainable AI model that predicts injury occurrence using only simple questionnaire-based data and visually identifies key predictors. Survey data were collected from 239 adult players registered with the Korea Field Hockey Association in 2024, including university and professional team athletes. Ten variables were used: sex, team affiliation, playing experience, player level, warm-up duration, weekly training hours and days, and physical indicators (age, height, weight). Injury was defined as an event within the past year that resulted in being unable to train for more than 24 h. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were compared. The final model—Logistic Regression—underwent SHAP-based visualization for interpretability. The Logistic Regression model showed the best performance in recall (0.6810 ± 0.0983), F1-score (0.6260 ± 0.0499), and AUC (0.6515 ± 0.0393). SHAP analysis identified Group, Training Time, Weight, and Player Level as key predictors, and visualized their contributions to individual predictions. This study demonstrates that a lightweight, interpretable injury prediction model using only simple survey data can achieve practical performance.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data from adult patients who received non-surgical or surgical treatment after the first CT scan with craniocerebral injuries from January 2020 to August 2021. The radiomics features were extracted by PyRadiomics. Dimensionality reduction was then performed using the max relevance and min-redundancy algorithm (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), with 10-fold cross-validation to select the best radiomics features. Three parsimonious machine learning classifiers, multinomial logistic regression, a support vector machine (SVM), and a naive Bayes (Gaussian distribution) classifier, were used to construct radiomics models. A personalized emergency prognostic nomogram for cranial injuries was created using a logistic regression model based on selected radiomic labels and patients' baseline information at emergency admission. Results: The mRMR algorithm and the LASSO regression model extracted 22 top-ranked radiologic features and based on these image histologic features, the emergency brain injury prediction model was built with SVM, logistic regression, and naive Bayes classifiers, respectively. The SVM model showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in training cohort for the 3 classifications, indicating that the SVM model is more stable and accurate. Moreover, a nomogram prediction model for Glasgow Outcome Scale prognostic score in patients was constructed. Conclusion: We established a nomogram for predicting patients' prognosis through radiomic features and clinical characteristics, which provides some data support and guidance for clinical prediction of patients' brain injury prognosis and intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009694754"

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008248118"

However, challenges such as the lack of domain-specific datasets and the complexity of athletes’ movements continue to hinder progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced pose estimation framework tailored to badminton players, built upon an improved YOLOv8-Pose architecture. In particular, we introduce an efficient local attention (ELA) mechanism that effectively captures fine-grained spatial dependencies and contextual information, thereby significantly improving the keypoint localization accuracy and overall pose estimation performance. To support this study, we construct a dedicated badminton pose dataset comprising 4000 manually annotated samples, captured using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The raw data undergo careful processing and refinement through a combination of depth-assisted annotation and visual inspection to ensure high-quality ground truth keypoints. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple attention modules and their integration strategies within the network, offering generalizable insights to enhance pose estimation models in other sports domains. The experimental results show that the proposed ELA-enhanced YOLOv8-Pose model consistently achieves superior accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), object keypoint similarity (OKS), and percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), highlighting its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sports vision tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011870922"

This study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models that accurately predict game outcomes in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). Method: A total of 859 games from the 2021 to 2023 regular seasons were analyzed, using both traditional baseball statistics and advanced sabermetric indicators such as the Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+), Weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA), and Percentage of Leadoff Batters on Base (PLOB%). Five machine learning models—decision tree, logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were constructed and assessed through a five-fold cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, F1 scores, sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC-ROC. Results: Among the models, logistic regression and XGBoost achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 and an AUC-ROC from 0.97 to 0.98. The feature importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that the wRC+ and PLOB% were the most influential predictors, reflecting the offensive efficiency and pitching control. Conclusion: The results suggest that combining interpretable machine learning with sabermetrics provides valuable insights for coaches and analysts in professional baseball. Furthermore, incorporating performance weighting based on game context may further enhance model accuracy.

One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features, while normalization standardizes numerical data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that PFA-INT-SVM significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

It shows great promise in areas such as injury prediction and athlete performance forecasting. This study explores the potential of using machine learning to predict archers' performance based solely on specific physiological parameters. Initially, the total success score of each archer was recorded after three sets of six shots, alongside measurements of their quiet eye parameters. The quiet eye represents the final fixation of the eye on a target, critical for task accuracy. Based on their scores, archers were categorized as low-potential athletes or high-potential athletes using an machine learning clustering method. Subsequently, machine learning classification algorithms were applied to predict the performance class of archers using only quiet eye parameters. The study involved 18 archers (equally split by sex) who had consistently trained in archery for at least two years. The results indicated that the performance classification of archers could be predicted with approximately 90% reliability using only quiet eye data. The findings suggest that machine learning based on quiet eye parameters offers a time-efficient alternative to traditional methods for identifying high-potential archers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219593788"

Patients and Methods: We included adult patients (18 years or older) admitted to intensive care unit with at least stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI) at a tertiary medical center, using retrospective data collected between January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2022. The data were accessed and analyzed during the period from March 1st, 2023, through July 28th, 2023. The psAKI was defined as AKI stage 3 lasting for ≥72 hours or AKI leading to death in 48 hours or kidney replacement therapy in 1 day. The performance of the PersEA model, a boosted tree algorithm fed by hourly patient data via electronic health records to provide real-time psAKI predictions, was evaluated using specific metrics that penalize late alarms. We measured the area under the receiver operating characteristic and the area under the precision-recall curves. Results: After screening, 4479 patients from the Mayo Clinic cohort were included in the current external validation study, with 234 (5.22%) having psAKI. Results from the Amsterdam UMCdb (531 patients, 59 [11.11%] positive) and MIMIC-III (495 patients, 57 [11.52%] positive) cohorts were obtained in a prior development study.

SailGP is a relatively new sailing event driven by a passion for speed and innovation. The racing series brings excitement and thrill to the world of sailing that has been relatively unexplored. As a pioneer work in the academic community, our work showcases the power of data-driven approaches in enhancing performance and decision-making at high-performance sailing events. We explore data mining techniques on datasets collected at high-performance sailing events in Bermuda in 2021 and Italy in 2023. By analysing race data, the study aims to gain insights into the relationship between variables such as wind speed, wind direction, foil usage, and daggerboard adjustments, and their impact on boat speed. For a comprehensive understanding, we used three distinct methodologies. Various prediction models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and a stacked model, were employed and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score and mean squared error. The results demonstrate the models’ ability to accurately predict boat speed. Anomaly detection techniques examined boat stability, adding a new chapter to the research. Additionally, we introduced a reinforcement learning approach to identify optimal settings for speed enhancement, representing another new dimension of the study. These findings refine race strategies, optimise sail and rudder settings, and improve performance in SailGP races.

Early prediction of DILI is crucial for developing safer pharmaceuticals, yet current in vitro and in vivo testing methods are complex and cumbersome. In this study, we developed an extreme gradient boosting (XGB)-powered machine learning (ML) model for DILI prediction. Comparing various DILI prediction models is challenging because they rely on different public data sets. We comprehensively evaluated the proposed BoostDILI model to address two crucial questions: 1. Can insights derived from public data sets help in DILI prediction for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs? 2. Can we generate structural alerts to improve the model’s explainability? To address the first question, we developed a DILI prediction model using four publicly available data sets. This effort led to the creation of the BoostDILI model, which achieved a 5-fold CV accuracy of 0.70. A sequential feature selection method was employed to identify relevant descriptors. This model integrates feature-level representations derived from RDKit (12 features) and Mordred (23 features) features. Bayesian statistics was applied to identify high-performance substructures iteratively, and a structural alerts model was developed to address the second question. The developed model was further validated with two FDA-approved drug data sets, DILIst and DILIRank. The BoostDILI model offers a trustable solution for evaluating the DILI risk in preclinical research. The structural alerts help in identifying the substructures that may be responsible for DILI.

However, factors influencing injury risk scores from a force plate system (SpartaScience™) and the effects of experimental perturbations on these scores remain unclear. Methods Healthy males (n = 823; 22.7 ± 3.9 yr) performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) on SpartaScience™ force plates. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of the system's proprietary Musculoskeletal (MSK) Health score, which were then experimentally perturbed. Twelve males (30.9 ± 4.3 yr) participated in a test-retest reliability study, performing three standard CMJs and one experimentally manipulated jump (50% effort) due to the observed relationship between the MSK Health score, vertical jump height, and body weight. Results The MSK Health score was negatively correlated with vertical jump height and positively with body weight (R2 = 0.59, P < 0.001). Each inch increase in jump height decreased the MSK Health score by an average of 1.27 units (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.36), whereas each pound of body weight increased it by 0.12 units (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.13). Notably, 83% of participants in the reliability study improved their MSK Health score on the 50% effort jump. Conclusions The study revealed atypical relationships between MSK Health scores, vertical jump height, and body weight, with vertical jump height playing a majority role in predicting the principal output (MSK Health score). Findings indicated a higher injury risk with greater jump height but a lower risk with increased body weight. In addition, MSK Health scores paradoxically improved with lower effort (i.e., lower vertical jump height), which highlights the dangers of using undisclosed and unvetted algorithms for the prediction of health outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001079370"

The design of the system is based on our research and development efforts in the areas of machine learning, sensor networks, and mobile applications. Results of this effort have been integrated in a testbed in the football stadium at Georgia Tech to determine their effectiveness, identify new opportunities, and explore the possibility of commercialization. Outcomes to date include: (1) identification of plays using video clips, a “grammar” constraining play sequences, and narrations of the game; (2) A sensor network that monitors structural vibrations of a stadium to determine the level of fans’ excitement; (3) Mobile apps to enable fans to review annotated plays that have happened so far, “e-meet” and chat with each other about the game, and play sports-related games during breaks in the game.

This requires an accurate and efficient prediction of the development of pressure injuries. We aimed to develop a method for estimating skin temperature changes due to ischemia and inflammation using temperature sensors placed under bedsheets to provide an objective, non-invasive, and non-constrained risk assessment tool. Methods: This study consisted of a thermal skin simulation study and a descriptive correlation study in healthy participants. A thermal skin simulation study was conducted using a model reproducing the body surface (underwear, diaper, or wet diaper conditions) and bed environment. In a descriptive-correlational study, the participants lay supine on a mattress with a temperature sensor attached to their sacral skin. Findings: The thermal skin simulation study showed that temperature changes in the skin can be estimated under the sheets by inputting time-shifted temperature data into machine learning (R2 = 0.9967 for underwear, 0.9950 for diapers, and 0.9869 for wet diapers). It was also demonstrated that the absolute skin temperature of a healthy individual (N = 17) could be estimated with the best accuracy by inputting time-shifted data into an extra-tree regressor (R2 = 0.8145). Interpretation: A combination of interface pressure and temperature sensors can be used to estimate skin temperature changes. These findings contribute to the development of a skin temperature measurement method that can capture temperature changes over time in clinical settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212327250"

HPE, a fundamental task in applications such as sports analytics and surveillance systems, involves predicting human joint locations from visual data. Despite substantial progress driven by deep learning advancements, particularly in handling occlusions and crowded environments, a comprehensive integration of these innovations remains limited in current literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel HPE and SEC system featuring a robust six-stage pipeline. The workflow begins with preprocessing steps, including video-to-image sequence conversion, floor removal to reduce noise, grayscale transformation, and human silhouette extraction via binary masks. Human detection is performed using the GrabCut algorithm. Full-body feature extraction incorporates 1-D Fourier Transform, 2-D energy-based motion analysis, 0–180° intensity mapping via the Radon Transform algorithm, and movable body part detection using Fourier-Based Correlation. Key point features are characterized through the degree of freedom, human landmark detection via the HSV algorithm, and angular point analysis using the media pipe algorithm. Features are then optimized using the Ray Optimizer and classified through a Neuro-Fuzzy classifier.

Among these industries, the sports sector is experiencing significant transformation, which needs support in accurately monitoring athlete predicting and performance injuries arising due to traditional methods’ limitations. Keeping the above in mind, in this article, we present the Intelligent Sports Management System (ISMS) with the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and neural networks (NNs), which enhance athlete monitoring and injury prediction. Our proposed ISMS consists of several layers: user interface, business logic layer, data management layer, integration layer, analytics and AI layer, IoT layer, and security layer. To facilitate interactions for athletes, coaches, and administrators, our planned ISMS integrates a user-friendly interface accessible through web and mobile applications. Besides, scheduling and event management are managed by the business logic layer. Similarly, the data management layer can process and store comprehensive data from various sources. To ensure smooth data exchange, the integration layer connects the ISMS with third-party services, and the analytics and AI layer leverages machine learning to provide actionable insights on performance and outcomes. In addition, the IoT layer collects real-time data from sensors and wearable devices, which is essential for performance analysis and injury prevention. Finally, the security layer ensures data integrity and confidentiality with robust encryption and access controls. To evaluate the system performance in different scenarios, we performed many experiments, which show that the proposed ISMS model shows the system efficacy in improving accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.97), recall (0.91), precision (0.93), F1 score (0.95), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.6), mean square error (MSE) (0.8), and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.9), compared to traditional methods.

Methods: The sample consisted of 25 players from one of the 16 teams participating in the Persian Gulf Pro League during the 2022--2023 season. Player injury data and raw GPS data from all training and competition sessions throughout the football league season were gathered (214 training sessions and 34 competition sessions). The acute-tochronic workload ratio was calculated separately for each variable using a ratio of 1:3 weeks. Finally, the decision tree algorithm with machine learning was utilised to assess the predictive power of injury occurrence based on the acute-to-chronic workload ratio. Results: The results showed that the variable of the number of decelerations had the highest predictive power compared to other variables [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, recall = 87.5%, precision = 58.3%, accuracy = 94.7%]. Conclusion: Although none of the selected external load variables in this study had high predictive power (AUC > 0.95), due to the high predictive power of injury of the number of deceleration variables compared with other variables, the necessity of attention and management of this variable as a risk factor for injury occurrence is essential for preventing future injuries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217873483"

This paper proposes a novel AI-driven image recognition system for automatically detecting offside and foul events in football matches. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention or traditional image processing techniques, our approach utilizes a hybrid deep learning model that combines advanced object tracking with motion analysis to deliver real-time, precise event detection. The system employs a robust, self-learning algorithm that leverages spatiotemporal features from match footage to track player movements and ball dynamics. By analyzing the continuous flow of video data, the model detects offside positions and identifies foul types such as tackles, handballs, and dangerous play—through a dynamic pattern recognition process. This multi- tiered approach overcomes traditional methods’ limitations by accurately identifying critical events with minimal latency, even in complex, high-speed scenarios. In experiments conducted on diverse datasets of live match footage, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.85% for offside detection and 98.56% for foul identification, with precision rates of 98.32% and 97.12%, respectively. The system's recall rates of 97.45% for offside detection and 96.85% for foul recognition demonstrate its reliability in real-world applications.

Methods: Player match performance data were captured by Stats Perform for every National Rugby League season from 2018 until 2022; a total of five seasons. The dataset was divided into offensive and defensive variables and further split according to player position. Five machine learning algorithms (Principal Component Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Regression Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boost) were considered in the analysis, which ultimately generated Wins Created and Losses Created for offensive and defensive performance, respectively. These two metrics were combined to create a final metric of Net Wins Added. The validity of these player performance metrics against traditional objective and subjective measures of performance in rugby league were evaluated. Results: The metrics correctly predicted the winner of 80.9% of matches, as well as predicting the number of team wins per season with an RMSE of 1.9. The metrics displayed moderate agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.505) when predicting team of the year award recipients. When predicting State of Origin selection, the metrics displayed moderate agreement for New South Wales (0.450) and substantial agreement for Queensland (0.652).

In this work, we collect hand and arm inertial data of basketball shots and perform deep analysis to determine key factors that contribute to three main questions: the shot outcomes, the position of shots, and the experience level of players. We also investigate how well machine learning-based models can answer these three questions. To do this, we engineered statistical-based features from the shot inertial data. Then, we trained and evaluated the performance of five machine learning models. The results show that the experience level of the player can be accurately determined from the inertial data by both an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector classifier (SVC). An extreme gradient boosted (XGBoost) model had the best success classifying the location from which the shot was taken with an accuracy of 94%. Finally, SVC predicted the outcome of the shot as either a miss or a basket, with an accuracy of 76%. Further analysis revealed that the arm and hand accelerations and rotation in the y-axis are critical factors in basketball shooting.

This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to assess injury risk by analyzing key physiological metrics such as heart rate, impact force, activity duration, and skin temperature. A dataset containing athlete performance data under different conditions is examined to identify the predictive relevance of these features. Traditional classification methods faced challenges due to the non-collinear nature of the data, whereas boosting techniques proved to be the most effective, delivering the highest prediction accuracy. This research evaluates various ML models, including boosting algorithms, neural networks, and conventional classifiers, comparing their predictive capabilities. Using AutoML, AutoGluon determined that the Weighted Ensemble model outperformed other approaches, achieving an accuracy of 81.17%. To complement the injury prediction model, this study also incorporates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Training Recommendation Model, which dynamically adjusts training regimens based on real-time physiological and biomechanical feedback. By optimizing training intensity and workload distribution, the RL model helps minimize injury risk while ensuring an appropriate and effective training regimen. The recommendation system is designed to be flexible, allowing for continuous adaptation and improvement as more data becomes available. This integrated approach enhances informed decision-making for coaches, medical professionals, and athletes, facilitating proactive injury prevention while maintaining peak performance levels. By leveraging ML-driven injury prediction and RL-based training recommendations, this study presents a comprehensive, scalable, and adaptable framework for athlete management.

Therefore, in this study, we introduce PassAI, a novel machine learning framework for classifying soccer passes success or failure using spatiotemporal tracking images and player-specific statistical profiles. PassAI addresses these challenges with an original dual-stream architecture that processes image-based and tabular features separately and then combines them for final prediction. Additionally, a two-stage explanation module was implemented to provide interpretable insights from both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. This module allows end users (e.g., coaches and analysts) understand whether pass outcomes depend more on contextual dynamics or individual player traits. In experiments involving 6,349 passes from professional Japanese soccer league games, PassAI outperformed state-of-the-art models - including convolutional neural network-based and graph neural network-based approaches, as well as existing pass prediction models - by more than 5% in accuracy. It also provided interpretable feedback through visual saliency maps and feature sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, RemOve And Retrain was also performed to verify the faithfulness of the generated explanation, and the visual saliency maps were highly faithful.

However, postoperative rehabilitation remains a crucial challenge, necessitating innovative approaches for enhancing physical recovery and quality of life. Personalized sports recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging sports analytics, machine learning, and biomechanical modeling to tailor rehabilitation exercises. Traditional methods rely on generalized rehabilitation protocols, often failing to consider individual patient conditions, recovery progress, and biomechanical constraints. These limitations hinder optimal rehabilitation and prolong recovery times. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating robotic-assisted assessment with personalized sports analytics. Our approach utilizes a Dynamic Sports Performance Network (DSPN), which combines spatiotemporal data analysis, reinforcement learning, and real-time feedback mechanisms to optimize exercise recommendations. By incorporating multi-agent learning and predictive modeling, the system adapts rehabilitation plans based on patient performance, ensuring a tailored and effective recovery process. The system can integrate wearable sensor data and EMG signals to further refine exercise precision and monitor muscular responses in real time. Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional rehabilitation strategies, offering higher precision in exercise recommendations, improved adherence rates, and enhanced recovery efficiency.

This paper addresses the critical problem of inconsistent and non-adaptive performance benchmarking, which limits objective comparisons across players, teams, and historical data. We propose a novel data-driven framework leveraging machine learning (ML) to create an adaptive benchmarking system that automatically evaluates performance trends, identifies anomalies, and provides actionable insights. Our approach integrates deep learning, reinforcement learning, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale datasets, including biometrics, match statistics, and contextual variables. A key innovation is the hybrid ML pipeline combining supervised and unsupervised learning, where neural networks and clustering algorithms work together to dynamically rank and compare athlete performances based on evolving game conditions. Furthermore, we introduce anomaly detection and regression-based models to detect deviations from expected performance trends and offer personalized recommendations for training optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving superior accuracy in performance evaluation compared to conventional statistical methods. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to enhance transparency and ensure interpretability of model outputs for coaches, analysts, and athletes.

This task poses significant challenges due to the inherently interactive and unpredictable nature of sports, where abrupt changes in velocity and direction are prevalent. Traditional approaches, including (S)ARIMA(X), Kalman filters (KF), and Particle filters (PF), often struggle to model the non-linear dynamics present in such scenarios. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers, offer greater flexibility and accuracy but frequently fail to explicitly capture the interplay between temporal dependencies and contextual interactions, which are critical in chaotic sports environments.In this paper, we evaluate these models and assess their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results reveal key performance trade-offs across input history length, generalizability, and the ability to incorporate contextual information. ML-based methods demonstrated substantial improvements over linear models across forecast horizons of up to 2s. Among the tested architectures, our hybrid LSTM augmented with contextual information achieved the lowest final displacement error (FDE) of 1.51m, outperforming temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN), graph attention network (GAT), and Transformers, while also requiring less data and training time compared to GAT and Transformers.

Prior research has shown that individuals with NSSI exhibit abnormal pain perception; however, the pain-processing neural circuits underlying NSSI remain poorly understood. This study leverages graph neural networks to predict NSSI risk and examine the learned connectivity of neural underpinnings using multimodal data. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were collected from 50 patients with NSSI, 79 healthy controls (HC), and 44 patients with mental disorder who did not engage in NSSI as disease controls (DC). We constructed pain-related brain networks for each participant. An interpretable graph attention networks (GAT) model was developed, considering demographic factors, to predict NSSI risk and highlight NSSI-specific connectivity using learned attention matrices. Results: The proposed GAT model based on imaging data achieved an accuracy of 80%, and increased to 88% when self-reported pain scales were incorporated alongside imaging data in distinguishing patients with NSSI from HC. It highlighted amygdala-parahippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-insula connectivity as pivotal in NSSI-related pain processing. After incorporating imaging data of DC, the model’s accuracy reached 74%, underscoring consistent neural connectivity patterns. The GAT model demonstrates high predictive accuracy for NSSI, enhanced by including self-reported pain scales. Conclusions: Our proposed GAT model underscores the significance in the functional integration of limbic regions, paralimbic regions and IFG in NSSI pain processing. Our findings suggest altered pain processing as a key mechanism in NSSI, providing insights for potential neural modulation intervention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008762260"

In particular, we suggest the use of the MLP-LSTM model to forecast athletic injuries and prescribe individualized workout schedules relevant to the specific athlete. Multilayer perceptron and long short-term memory network are used together for designing MLP-LSTM architecture that has the capacity to grasp temporal patterns present in athlete information and predict injuries. It will employ training data, athletes' profile, and data on their past and present injuries and using statistical and mathematical models to read into it and look for signs that may be precursors to possible injuries. Accordingly, individual training schedules are suggested with the intent to minimize the chances for sustaining an injury while at the same time maximize performance. The creation of this system appears to be fundamentally proactive with regards to athletic training because it puts it in the hands of the coaches and athletes involved to allow prevention of injuries when they are most likely to occur.

Consequently, injury prediction and prevention are also increasingly addressed from a statistical perspective. In a pilot study, several machine learning algorithms and conventional statistical approaches have been compared regarding their potential to predict time-loss non-contact lower-body injuries in professional youth soccer players, using data from a prospective cohort study with 56 players of which 22 were injured. The covariates considered here include basic soccer-related as well as neuromuscular and biomechanical features derived from physical testing. Lasso regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines are considered for binary classification and prediction of an injury occurrence. The prediction results from a cross-validated procedure are compared regarding multiple quality measures. Post Lasso logistic regression with a reduced penalty gives the best results with an accuracy of 0.625, a predictive likelihood of 0.593, and a Brier score of 0.228. The respective sensitivity and specificity are 0.773 and 0.529, with an AUC of 0.672. Moreover, an XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Lasso model in terms of accuracy (0.661), while for the other performance measures it is dominated by the Lasso. In addition to the specific results on the available injury data set, the proposed comparison procedure of several models for binary prediction provides a generally applicable analysis guideline. This roadmap can also be applied in other contexts where similarly structured small but rich data sets are available. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003844856"

These were adjusted by a situational importance modifier based on player positions and combined into a final metric called “Net Wins Added”. An Elo rating variant modified to suit a rugby league context was also created to provide a strength of opponent multiplier for player performance. The validity of these metrics against traditional objective and subjective performance measures in rugby league were evaluated. The metrics predicted seasonal team wins with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.9 and Player of the Year top 10 leaderboard points with an RMSE of 8.2. The metrics displayed substantial agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.82) when predicting experts’ Team of the Year award recipients and substantial agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.75) when predicting players’ Team of the Year awards.

Players were monitored for upper extremity injuries throughout a baseball season. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of these clinical variables using five models: Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and Support Vector Machine. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis was used to clarify each feature’s role in injury prediction. During the season, 28 players experienced injuries. CatBoost (accuracy: 0.70 ± 0.05; AUC: 0.66 ± 0.05) and logistic regression (accuracy: 0.63 ± 0.07; AUC: 0.64 ± 0.08) excelled in bootstrapped evaluations and performed well in independent tests, with CatBoost maintaining an accuracy of 0.70 and an AUC of 0.62. Including GIRD had a negligible effect on CatBoost’s accuracy. This integration with SHAP analyses enables a better understanding of each clinical feature’s role in predicting injuries, laying the foundation for personalized injury prevention strategies.

Impact Statement: Our study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to address the issues of poor generalization and weak interpretability commonly encountered in disease prediction using traditional machine learning (ML) models. Introduction: AKI is a severe postoperative complication, especially in elderly patients with declining renal function. Current AKI prediction models rely on ML, but their lack of interpretability and generalizability limits clinical use. LLMs, with extensive pretraining and text generation capabilities, offer a new solution. Methods: We applied prompt engineering and knowledge distillation based on instruction fine-tuning to optimize LLMs for AKI prediction. The framework was tested on 2,649 samples from 2 private Chinese hospitals and one public South Korean dataset, which were divided into internal and external datasets. Results: The LLM framework showed robust external performance, with accuracy rates: commercial LLMs (internal: 63.73%, external: 68.73%), open-source LLMs (internal: 63.70%, external: 64.24%), and ML models (internal: 63.93%, external: 58.27%). LLMs also provided human-readable explanations for better clinical understanding. Conclusion: The proposed framework showcases the potential of LLMs to enhance generalization and interpretability in postoperative AKI prediction, paving the way for more robust and transparent predictive solutions in clinical settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001022751"

The methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and testing. Various models are evaluated, including enhanced versions of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Network, and Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network. Unlike existing studies that focus on end-of-game features, this research incorporates real-time features like half-time results and goals for in-game decision-making. Advanced data normalization and sampling methods, such as SVM-SMOTE and Near-Miss, are applied to improve model performance. Models are assessed using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area under the ROC Curve. Results indicate that the Feedforward Neural Network excels in predicting game results, while Logistic Regression is best for predicting under and over 2.5 goals. The integration of Random Forest and XGBoost in a voting model consistently achieves the highest accuracy across both prediction tasks. The combined use of data from the three leagues further validates the models’ robustness and generalizability. This study demonstrates the potential of machine and deep learning to enhance soccer game predictions through advanced techniques and comprehensive data analysis, making significant contributions to sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209997521"

Therefore, the incorporation of science into the sport is constantly growing, with increasing investments in performance analysis and sports prediction industries. This study aims to (i) highlight the use of complex networks as an alternative tool for predicting soccer match outcomes and (ii) show how the combination of structural analysis of passing networks with match statistical data can provide deeper insights into the game patterns and strategies used by teams. In order to do so, complex network metrics and match statistics were used to build machine learning models that predict the wins and losses of soccer teams in different leagues. The results showed that models based on passing networks were as effective as 'traditional' models, which use general match statistics. Another finding was that by combining both approaches, more accurate models were obtained than when they were used separately, demonstrating that the fusion of such approaches can offer a deeper understanding of game patterns, allowing the comprehension of tactics employed by teams relationships between players, their positions and interactions during matches. It is worth mentioning that both network metrics and match statistics were important and impactful for the mixed model. Furthermore, the use of networks with a lower granularity of temporal evolution (such as creating a network for each half of the match) performed better than a single network for the entire game. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208975480"

The aim of this study is to calculate the risk of presenting musculoskeletal injuries in surgeons after surgical practice. Methods: Cross-sectional study carried out using an online form (12/2021–03/2022) aimed at members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons. Demographic variables on physical and professional activity were recorded, as well as musculoskeletal pain (MSP) associated with surgical activity. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to identify risk factors associated with the development of MSP based on personalized surgical activity. To achieve this, a risk algorithm was computed and an online machine learning calculator was created to predict them. Physiotherapeutic recommendations were generated to address and alleviate each MSP. Results: A total of 651 surgeons (112 trainees, 539 specialists). 90.6% reported MSP related to surgical practice, 60% needed any therapeutic measure and 11.7% required a medical leave. In the long term, MSP was most common in the cervical and lumbar regions (52.4, 58.5%, respectively). Statistically significant risk factors (OR CI 95%) were for trunk pain, long interventions without breaks (3.02, 1.65–5.54). Obesity, indicated by BMI, to lumbar pain (4.36, 1.84–12.1), while an inappropriate laparoscopic screen location was associated with cervical and trunk pain (1.95, 1.28–2.98 and 2.16, 1.37–3.44, respectively). A predictive model and an online calculator were developed to assess MSP risk. Furthermore, a need for enhanced ergonomics training was identified by 89.6% of surgeons. Conclusions: The prevalence of MSP among surgeons is a prevalent but often overlooked health concern. Implementing a risk calculator could enable tailored prevention strategies, addressing modifiable factors like ergonomics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203964397"

This method aims to enhance the protective effect of vehicle front-end for e-bike riders by encompassing a broader range of test scenarios. Initially, large-scale rider injury response data were collected using automated Madymo simulations. A machine learning model was then trained to accurately predict the risk of rider injury under varied crash conditions. Subsequently, this model was integrated into a multi-objective optimization framework, combined with multi-criteria decision analysis, to effectively evaluate and rank various design alternatives on the Pareto frontier. This process entailed a comparative analysis of the design in a baseline scenario before and after optimization, focusing on both kinematic and injury responses of riders. Through detailed injury mechanism analysis, key design variables such as the height of the hood front and the width of the bumper were identified. This led to the proposal of specific optimization strategies for these structural parameters. The results from this study demonstrate that the proposed optimization method not only guides the design process accurately and efficiently but also balances the injury risks across different body parts. This approach significantly reduces the injury risk for riders in car-to-e-bike collisions and provides actionable insights for vehicle design enhancements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202288648"

By taking into account the factors that contribute to securing one of the top positions in the league standings, coaches are encouraged to adopt ball possession strategies with patience and short passes to create gaps in the opponent’s defense and, at the right moment, execute through balls aiming to enter the attacking third and create goal opportunities. On the other hand, teams are advised to avoid long passes, as these may lead to a loss of team cohesion and create large distances between the lines. Finally, this information is also useful for team scouts in identifying players who are suitable for implementing the aforementioned strategies. Introduction: Performance analysis is essential for coaches and a topic of extensive research. The advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has revolutionized sports analytics. Aim: The primary aim of this article is to present a robust, explainable machine learning (ML) model that identifies the key factors that contribute to securing one of the top three positions in the standings of the French Ligue 1, ensuring participation in the UEFA Champions League for the following season. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed data from all 380 matches of the 2022–23 French Ligue 1 season. The data were obtained from the publicly-accessed website “whoscored” and included 34 performance indicators. This study employed Sequential Forward Feature Selection (SFFS) and various ML algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), to create a robust, explainable model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) model was used to enhance model interpretability. Results: The K-means Cluster Analysis categorized teams into groups (TOP TEAMS, 3 teams/REST TEAMS, 17 teams), and the ML models provided significant insights into the factors influencing league standings. The LR classifier was the best-performing classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75.13%, a recall of 76.32%, an F1-score of 48.03%, and a precision of 35.17%. “SHORT PASSES” and “THROUGH BALLS” were features found to positively influence the model’s predictions, while “TACKLES ATTEMPTED” and “LONG BALLS” had a negative impact. Conclusions: Our model provided satisfactory predictive accuracy and clear interpretability of results, which gave useful information to stakeholders. Specifically, our model suggests adopting a strategy during the ball possession phase that relies on short passes (avoiding long ones) and aiming to enter the attacking third and the opponent’s penalty area with through balls. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205251794"

However, most available head injury models are ""average""models that employ a single set of head geometry (e.g., 50th-percentile U.S. male) without considering variability in these parameters across the human population. A significant variability of head shapes exists in U.S. Army soldiers, evident from the Anthropometric Survey of U.S. Army Personnel (ANSUR II). The objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of head shape on the predicted risk of traumatic brain injury from computational head injury models. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 25 human subjects are collected. These images are registered to the standard MNI152 brain atlas, and the resulting transformation matrix components (called head shape parameters) are used to quantify head shapes of the subjects. A generative machine learning model is used to generate 25 additional head shape parameter datasets to augment our database. Head injury models are developed for these head shapes, and a rapid injurious head rotation event is simulated to obtain several brain injury predictor variables (BIPVs): Peak cumulative maximum principal strain (CMPS), average CMPS, and the volume fraction of brain exceeding an injurious CMPS threshold. A Gaussian process regression model is trained between head shape parameters and BIPVs, which is then used to study the relative sensitivity of the various BIPVs on individual head shape parameters. We distinguish head shape parameters into 2 types: Scaling components,, and that capture the breadth, length, and height of the head, respectively, and shearing components (, and) that capture the relative skewness of the head shape. Results: An overall positive correlation is evident between scaling components and BIPVs. Notably, a very high, positive correlation is seen between the BIPVs and the head volume. As an example, a 57% increase in peak CMPS was noted between the smallest and the largest investigated head volume parameters. The variation in shearing components, and on average does not cause notable changes in the BIPVs. From the Gaussian process regression model, all 3 BIPVs showed an increasing trend with each of the 3 scaling components, but the BIPVs are found to be most sensitive to the height dimension of the head. From the Sobol sensitivity analysis, the scaling parameter contributes nearly 60% to the total variance in peak and average CMPS; contributes approximately 20%, whereas contributes less than 5%. The remaining contribution is from the 6 shearing components. Unlike peak and average CMPS, the VF-CMPS BIPV is associated with relatively evenly distributed Sobol indices across the 3 scaling parameters. Furthermore, the contribution of shearing components on the total variance in this case is negligible. Conclusions: Head shape has a considerable influence on the injury predictions of computational head injury models. Available ""average""head injury models based on a 50th-percentile U.S. male are likely associated with considerable uncertainty. In general, larger head sizes correspond to greater BIPV magnitudes, which point to potentially a greater injury risk under rapid neck rotation for people with larger heads. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202087050"

Because such data is extremely rich and complex, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Designing these indicators requires paying careful attention to a number of subtle issues from a methodological and evaluation perspective. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for handling them. Methodologically, we highlight that dependencies affect how to perform data partitioning for evaluation as well as the need to consider contextual factors. From an evaluation perspective, we draw a distinction between evaluating the developed indicators themselves versus the underlying models that power them. We argue that both aspects must be considered, but that they require different approaches. We hope that this article helps bridge the gap between traditional sports expertise and modern data analytics by providing a structured framework with practical examples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198858301"

The challenge of accurately predicting injuries presents an opportunity for researchers to develop prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence of such injuries. Consequently, this issue requires further investigation to obtain insights into effective mitigation strategies. In 120 male soccer players, the maximum isometric strength of the hip muscle groups was measured, and the strength ratios were calculated. Previous injury and anthropometric data were registered. Injury data were collected following the FIFA/UEFA consensus. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) was used to predict the incidence of injury, while the significant predictive variables of the k-NN algorithm were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model (LR) to analyze the likelihood of players sustaining a groin injury. The LR model determined two variables as significant predictors of groin injury. Players were less likely to sustain a groin injury by 76% for each decrease of the adductor/abductor isometric strength ratio in the non-dominant limb (OR = 0.238, CI 95% = [(0.098–0.572]). Players with a history of previous injury had a 67% greater risk of sustaining an injury (OR = 0.333, CI 95% = [(0.1068–1.038]). Isometric hip adductor and abductor strength imbalances of the non-dominant lower limb and a history of previous injury were risk factors for groin injury in soccer players. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004363815"

Methods: This was a retrospective study of tertiary hospitals in Seoul, Korea. It analyzed patients in 12 departments where many pressure injuries occurred, including 8 general wards and 4 intensive care units from January 2018 to May 2022. In total, 182 variables were included in the model development. A pressure injury prediction model was developed using the gradient boosting algorithm, logistic regression, and decision tree methods, and it was compared to the Braden scale. Results: Among the 1, 389, 660 general ward cases, there were 451 cases of pressure injuries, and among 139, 897 intensive care unit cases, there were 297 cases of pressure injuries. Among the tested prediction models, the gradient boosting algorithm showed the highest predictive performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the gradient boosting algorithm’s pressure injury prediction model in the general ward and intensive care unit was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.83~0.89) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.79~0.87), respectively. This model was integrated into the electronic health record system to show each patient’s probability for pressure injury occurrence, and the risk factors calculated every hour. Conclusion: The prediction model developed using the gradient boosting algorithm exhibited higher performance than the Braden scale. A clinical decision support system that automatically assesses pressure injury risk allows nurses to focus on patients at high risk for pressure injuries without increasing their workload. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204112961"

The data collected from 607 higher education students (mean age = 16.86; Std = 1.22), includes measurements from physical tests and activity records. The dataset comprises 29 variables, which were profiled and feature-engineered to enhance predictive accuracy for training procedures. We leveraged Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to determine the significance of features on outcomes and utilized Power BI to visualize the impact of aggregate features on running distance. Initial findings indicates that the optimal age range for focusing training efforts is between 16 and 17 years old. This result is supported by a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.42, stipulating a moderate positive relationship between the age group and the predicted performance outcomes based on key aggregate features. In particular, four key features significantly impact performance, while other variables have a minor influence. The study highlights the significance of these aggregate features in predicting training success. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of a robust reporting process and the use of predictive analysis in developing training programs. It identifies four critical features that have a substantial impact on realized performance. While these four features are paramount, the study also acknowledges that other variables, though less influential, may still affect the outcomes if considered. This comprehensive approach to data collection and analysis provides a solid foundation for optimizing athlete training programs, ensuring that training efforts are both targeted and effective.

Consequently, machine learning approaches have been developed to predict AKI ahead of time. However, the prevalence of AKI is often underestimated in state-of-the-art approaches, as they rely on an AKI event annotation solely based on creatinine, ignoring urine output. We construct and evaluate early warning systems for AKI in a multi-disciplinary ICU setting, using the complete KDIGO definition of AKI. We propose several variants of gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT)-based models, including a novel time-stacking based approach. A state-of-the-art LSTM-based model previously proposed for AKI prediction is used as a comparison, which was not specifically evaluated in ICU settings yet. Results: We find that optimal performance is achieved by using GBDT with the time-based stacking technique (AUPRC 65.7%, compared with the LSTM-based model's AUPRC 62.6%), which is motivated by the high relevance of time since ICU admission for this task. Both models show mildly reduced performance in the limited training data setting, perform fairly across different subcohorts, and exhibit no issues in gender transfer. Following the official KDIGO definition substantially increases the number of annotated AKI events. In our study GBDTs outperform LSTM models for AKI prediction. Generally, we find that both model types are robust in a variety of challenging settings arising for ICU data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197613202"

This study utilized machine learning methods to build predictive models using a comprehensive CrossFit (CF) dataset, aiming to reveal valuable insights into the factors influencing performance and emerging trends. METHODS: Random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to predict performance in four key weightlifting exercises within CF: clean and jerk, snatch, back squat, and deadlift. Performance was evaluated using R-squared (R2) values and mean squared error (MSE). Feature importance analysis was conducted using RF, XGBoost, and AdaBoost models. RESULTS: The RF model excelled in deadlift performance prediction (R2=0.80), while the MLR model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in clean and jerk (R2=0.93). Across exercises, clean and jerk consistently emerged as a crucial predictor. The feature importance analysis revealed intricate relationships among exercises, with gender significantly impacting deadlift performance. CONCLUSIONS: This research advances our understanding of performance prediction in CF through machine learning techniques. It provides actionable insights for practitioners, optimize performance, and demonstrates the potential for future advancements in data-driven sports analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197007402"

This paper overviews the current propositions and applications of pervasive computing and data analytics and our vision on how they should be used in future frameworks to contribute to the optimal balance of athletes’ performance and health requirements.

The first area is Sports Performance Optimization, in which we consider interesting recent advancements in data analytics for performance improvement, equipment design, and team member recruitment and selection. We will also briefly discuss how the betting industry has been relaying and developing sports analytics. The second area is Athlete’s Wellness and Wellbeing, which will discuss how wearables and data analytics have been used to assess physical activity and sedentary behavior profiles, sleep and circadian rhythm, nutrition and eating behavior, menstrual cycles, and training/performance readiness.

Female National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-I athlete injury prediction by vertical countermovement jump force-time metrics. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 783-786, 2024 - Vertical countermovement jump (CMJ) assessments on force plates have been purported to screen for musculoskeletal injury risk (MSKI) but with little scientific support. Thus, this study aimed to identify associations and noncontact lower-body injury predictability with CMJ force-time metrics in female athletes. The study entailed a retrospective analysis of routine injury and performance monitoring from 155 female National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I athletes. Noncontact lower-body injuries included in analysis were confirmed by medical staff, occurred during competition or training, resulted in time loss from training, and occurred within 3 months following CMJ testing (2 maximal effort, no arm swing, jumps on dual force plates). A total of 44 injuries occurred within 3 months following CMJ baseline testing and resulted in an average of 24.5 missed days from training. Those who sustained an injury were more likely to sustain another injury (15 of 44 injuries [33.1%]; odds ratio = 3.05 [95% CI = 1.31-6.99]). For every 1-unit increase from the mean in eccentric mean power and minimum eccentric force, there was a decrease in odds of sustaining a MSKI. Despite high overall model accuracy (85.6%), the receiving operating characteristic area under the curve (65.9%) was unacceptable and the true positive rate (recall) was 0.0%. Thus, no injuries in the testing data set were correctly classified by the logistic regression model with CMJ force-time metrics as predictors. Baseline CMJ assessment may not be useful for noncontact lower-body musculoskeletal injury screening or predictability in National Collegiate Athletics Association female athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188634421"

Limitations of standard fall risk screening questionnaires include suboptimal accuracy, missing data, and non-standard formats, which hinder early identification of risk and prevention of fall injury. We used machine learning methods to develop and evaluate electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to identify older adults at risk of fall-related injuries in a primary care population and compared this approach to standard fall screening questionnaires. Methods: Using patient-level clinical data from an integrated healthcare system consisting of 16-member institutions, we conducted a case–control study to develop and evaluate prediction models for fall-related injuries in older adults. Questionnaire-derived prediction with three questions from a commonly used fall risk screening tool was evaluated. We then developed four temporal machine learning models using routinely available longitudinal EHR data to predict the future risk of fall injury. We also developed a fall injury-prevention clinical decision support (CDS) implementation prototype to link preventative interventions to patient-specific fall injury risk factors. Results: Questionnaire-based risk screening achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) up to 0.59 with 23% to 33% similarity for each pair of three fall injury screening questions. EHR-based machine learning risk screening showed significantly improved performance (best AUROC = 0.76), with similar prediction performance between 6-month and one-year prediction models. Conclusions: The current method of questionnaire-based fall risk screening of older adults is suboptimal with redundant items, inadequate precision, and no linkage to prevention. A machine learning fall injury prediction method can accurately predict risk with superior sensitivity while freeing up clinical time for initiating personalized fall prevention interventions. The developed algorithm and data science pipeline can impact routine primary care fall prevention practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182168825"

Analyzing different types of plays (e.g., corner, penalty, free kicks) requires different considerations. This work focuses on the analysis of corner kick plays. However, the central ideas apply to analyzing all types of plays. While prior analyses (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) have explored the link between contextual factors (e.g., match period, type of defensive marking) and the level of success of a corner kick (e.g., shot, shot on goal, goal), there has been no attempt to combine spatiotemporal event data (sequences of ball movements through the field) and contextual information to determine when and how (strategy) a particular type of corner kick play (tactic) is more likely to succeed or not. To address this gap, we propose an approach that (1) transforms spatiotemporal data into an alternative representation suitable for mining sequential patterns, (2) identifies and characterizes the sequential patterns used by offensive teams to move the ball toward the scoring zone (tactics), and (3) extracts contrast patterns to identify under what conditions different tactics result in increased chances of success or failure; we call these conditions strategies. Our results suggest that favorable and unfavorable conditions for tactic application are not the same across different tactics, supporting the argument that there is a benefit in performing an analysis that treats different tactics separately, where spatiotemporal information plays a crucial role. Unlike prior works on the corner kick, our approach can capture how the interaction between multiple contextual factors impacts the outcome of a corner kick. At the same time, the results can be explained to others in natural languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192502714"

This study uses machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning clustering and decision tree models, to predict the composition of a winning roster. Our research identified three distinct clusters based on win percentage and the distribution of players across different skill levels. Successful teams typically have more top-tier players and a significant representation of players in the lowest skill level. In contrast, teams that spread their talent across the entire roster are less successful. We have noticed that players with average to above-average skills are notably affected by excessive playing time in the previous game, which leads to decreased performance and potential losses for the team in the next game. Considering the time of year and the gap between games, we recommend prioritizing the rest and recovery of top players, especially in the latter half of the season. It's crucial to ensure that players who are not as skilled as the top players but still make significant contributions to the team maintain consistent performance, especially during the first half of the season. Analyzing height's impact on basketball player performance has revealed practical insights that can empower coaches and management. We found that the shortest and tallest players often perform less than those of average height. Most top performers in the NBA tend to have heights closer to the average. However, for players who frequently operate near the net and encounter numerous rebound opportunities, it is generally preferable to have an average or taller player for slightly enhanced overall performance compared to below-average height players. Teams can use these insights to improve their roster construction and maximize player utilization by coaches from one game to the next. This research provides practical strategies that can be immediately implemented to enhance team performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219153488"

Sports analytics is pivotal in developing strategies and preparing players to achieve their best performance. It is especially important for team sports. However, gathering game data from previous game video recordings for sport analytics is time-consuming and tedious for coaches and their assistants. It could take them hours or days to sift through video clips to gather relevant information to prepare for their next game. This manual process called”tagging” in American football is essential to game planning for coaches. Automating this manual process can provide great benefits for teams in reducing the effort for data gathering and increasing the time for practice. Particularly, being able to automatically classify the offensive play formation for each play is crucial for developing game plans. This paper reports on our feasibility study on using machine learning techniques to automate the manual process. We studied offensive play formations extensively and devised an data augmentation strategy to generate realistic data for training and testing of our neural network. Using these synthetic data for training and testing, our neural network achieves an accuracy of 100% in recognizing 25 commonly used play formations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217806189"

This work addresses the lack of a smart and privacy-aware device to track and analyze players' shot localization accuracy, particularly for amateur players. We investigate a smart soccer net that can localize the point of impact of the ball from the perturbations of small inertial measuring sensors attached to the net. We train a feedforward neural network with raw data and statistical-based features, and a convolutional neural network with time- and frequency-based features from continuous wavelet transformation (CWT).

Four sensors deployed in a rhombus configuration and a model trained with CWT-based features achieved the best classification accuracy of 94 %. A cost-effective option of using three sensors in an inverted triangle configuration and the model trained with statistical-based features achieved 90 % accuracy.

Early prediction of injury risk is crucial for implementing effective prevention strategies. Incorporating biomechanics, this study focuses on basketball players at a university in Xi’an, China, aiming to develop a machine learning-based model to predict joint injury risk using easily collectable data such as training load, fatigue levels, and previous injury history. Considering regional differences, we observed that local and northern Chinese students are generally taller, while students from southern China are typically shorter. This anthropometric variation was included in our sampling and analysis. Utilizing data from 100 basketball players, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the best predictive performance with an accuracy of 85%. Key risk factors identified include high training load, elevated subjective fatigue scores, and a history of previous joint injuries. Additionally, biomechanical data were integrated to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of joint injuries, and the cellular responses to injury were explored.

The approach deals with data security protection and stability challenges in the model. Standard pattern recognition methods typically require the collection of data to be centralized, which is quite problematic in terms of privacy and limits the number of available datasets. The FL method is applied as a collaborative approach to training models with distributed datasets where privacy is maintained while the set datasets are augmented to improve the resulting model. Comparison was also made of the FL CNN architecture with that of a conventional centralized structure. The FL model reached a classification accuracy of 92.5%, Precision of 93.2%, and Recall of 91. 8%, and the F1-score was equal to 92. 5%. On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the centralized model I achieved was 89. 70% for centrepiece agreement and a precision rate of 90. 5%, a recall rate of 88.Therefore, the percentage increases by 5%, and the median and metamorphotic increases by 19%.

Prior approaches use simplistic models and lack data integration. Existing methods though valuable, have limitations in terms of their accuracy and precision. Hence, athlete-specific recommendations remain a challenge. The proposed method combines diverse attributes of biomechanical data, and athlete training load metrics, to build a comprehensive injury prediction model. It employs various machine learning approaches and establishes a feedback loop mechanism that enables athletes and coaches to act upon the model's predictions, adjusting training plans as needed. The system conducts a thorough comparison of various machine learning algorithms to identify and employ the most accurate algorithm. Bagging and Decision Tree consistently show better accuracy and precision, indicating their robustness in predicting athletic runner injuries.

Reducing basketball injury is one of the main aims of the study of basketball. In view of this, this paper proposes a monocular vision and FMS injury prediction model for basketball players. Aiming at the limitations of traditional FMS testing methods, this study introduces intelligent machine learning methods. In this study, random forest algorithm was introduced into OpenPose network to improve model node occlusion, missed detection or false detection. In addition, to reduce the computational load of the network, the original OpenPose network was replaced by a lightweight OpenPose network. The experimental results show that the average processing time of the proposed model is about 90 ms, and the output video frame rate is 10 frames per second, which can meet the real-time requirements. This study analysed the students participating in the basketball league of the College of Sports Science of Nantong University, and the results confirmed the accuracy of the injury prediction of college basketball players based on FMS scores.

Client bj-5 achieved outstanding levels of precision and recall, with both metrics reaching 88.86% and 89.07%, respectively. The precision-recall score reached 0.89, while the accuracy was 0.96. In contrast, bj-2 exhibited a minor delay, achieving precision and recall rates of 76.96% and 77.21%, respectively. In that respect, the system got an F1-Score of 77.01% and an accuracy of 91%. Additional macro, micro, and weighted averages examination highlighted the model's reliable performance across different serve shot motions. The highest value of the macro average (i.e., 77.06%) was observed in model bj-2, while the lowest was recorded in model bj-5 (i.e., only 83.35%). Micro averages of the model showed a more comprehensive range of model accuracy, which was only 76.99% in the model bj-2, and only the model's robustness was confirmed by observing weighted averages ranging from 76.94% (bj-2) to 88.94% (bj-5).

Not least in terms of scouting, where resources, both human and financial, are very limited. There are tools that offer a catalogue of matches from multiple leagues, but the coverage of women's football is still very limited. Not only for match viewing, but it is also difficult to collect line-ups and substitutions from minor leagues. Viewing more than 2-3 leagues with continuity is complicated and on a data level there are still several steps to go before we can create metrics-based scouting processes, as we know in men's football. Within this context, we have created WTDTool, a tool capable of collecting basic information about players from around 30 leagues and the minutes played during the season. This information consists of data such as name, date of birth, position or height. In addition, important data in scouting processes is also collected, such as market value, contract expiry date or injuries that the players have had. Once all the information has been collected automatically, alert-generating processes are executed. This allows you to focus on a small number of players that meet specific criteria without having to carry out a search beforehand. We conducted an expert evaluation, all of them combining different roles within women's football, and they all agreed that WTDTool is an easy to use tool, useful in the scouting process, that helps to make the scouting process more efficient and that the alarms effectively put the spotlight on players likely to be scouted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203109615"

NBA players face a variety of injuries, including muscle strains, ligament tears, bone fractures, sprains, and tendonitis, among others. Factors contributing to injury risk encompass a wide range of variables, including player physical characteristics, biomechanics, conditioning, fatigue, playing style, and history of previous injuries. Height, weight, wingspan, agility, sprint speed, and body fat percentage, which are the focus features of this study, can play pivotal roles in injury susceptibility.To address the multifaceted challenge of predicting injuries among NBA players based on various features, this project employs a range of machine learning models. Random Forest is utilized for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is applied for its instance-based learning that can classify players based on similar attributes, and Gradient Boosting is used to iteratively improve the model's predictions by focusing on the errors of previous iterations. These algorithms provide a robust framework for analyzing player data, enhancing the accuracy of injury predictions, and ultimately aiding in injury prevention and optimizing player performance. These models were evaluated using multiple metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy at 92.47%, followed by Gradient Boosting at 91.94%, and KNN at 88.17%.By analyzing historical injury data alongside these features, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay between player characteristics and injury risk and estimate injury probabilities. Through this approach, we provide valuable insight into injury prediction for NBA organizations, enhancing injury prevention and optimizing player performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203107731"

This is especially relevant in sedentary scenarios, where individuals often maintain static postures for extended periods—a significant part of daily life for many. The development of a system capable of detecting FHP is crucial, as it would not only alert users to correct their posture but also serve the broader goal of contributing to public health by preventing the progression of chronic injuries associated with this condition. However, despite significant advancements in estimating human poses from standard 2D images, most computational pose models do not include measurements of the craniovertebral angle, which involves the C7 vertebra, crucial for diagnosing FHP. Objective: Accurate diagnosis of FHP typically requires dedicated devices, such as clinical postural assessments or specialized imaging equipment, but their use is impractical for continuous, real-time monitoring in everyday settings. Therefore, developing an accessible, efficient method for regular posture assessment that can be easily integrated into daily activities, providing real-time feedback, and promoting corrective action, is necessary. Methods: The system sequentially estimates 2D and 3D human anatomical key points from a provided 2D image, using the Detectron2D and VideoPose3D algorithms, respectively. It then uses a graph convolutional network (GCN), explicitly crafted to analyze the spatial configuration and alignment of the upper body’s anatomical key points in 3D space. This GCN aims to implicitly learn the intricate relationship between the estimated 3D key points and the correct posture, specifically to identify FHP. Results: The test accuracy was 78.27% when inputs included all joints corresponding to the upper body key points. The GCN model demonstrated slightly superior balanced performance across classes with an F<inf>1</inf>-score (macro) of 77.54%, compared to the baseline feedforward neural network (FFNN) model’s 75.88%. Specifically, the GCN model showed a more balanced precision and recall between the classes, suggesting its potential for better generalization in FHP detection across diverse postures. Meanwhile, the baseline FFNN model demonstrates a higher precision for FHP cases but at the cost of lower recall, indicating that while it is more accurate in confirming FHP when detected, it misses a significant number of actual FHP instances. This assertion is further substantiated by the examination of the latent feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, where the GCN model presented an isotropic distribution, unlike the FFNN model, which showed an anisotropic distribution. Conclusions: Based on 2D image input using 3D human pose estimation joint inputs, it was found that it is possible to learn FHP-related features using the proposed GCN-based network to develop a posture correction system. We conclude the paper by addressing the limitations of our current system and proposing potential avenues for future work in this area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202213601"

The system starts with a GAN model trained on annotated handball video data, generating synthetic frames to improve the visual quality and realism of player appearances, thereby refining the input data for tracking. The Multi-Deep SORT algorithm, enhanced with GAN-generated features, improves object association and continuous player tracking. This framework addresses key challenges in active player tracking, handling occlusions, variations in player appearances, and complex interactions. Additionally, GAN-based enhancements improve accuracy in distinguishing active from inactive players, facilitating precise localization and recognition. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's efficacy in achieving high tracking accuracy, robustness, and differentiation between player activity levels.

The construction of a subjective prediction model for meniscus injury represents a potentially invaluable diagnostic tool for physicians. Nevertheless, given the variability of pathological manifestations among individual patients, machine learning-based models may produce errors when attempting to predict specific medical records. In order to mitigate this issue, the present study suggests the incorporation of metric learning within the machine learning (ML) modelling process, with the aim of reducing the intra-class spacing of comparable samples and thereby enhancing the classification accuracy of individual medical records.

Coaches rely on analytics to scout opponents and optimize play calls in gameplay. With the advancement in artificial intelligence, accessible and in-depth data collection has been enabled. The well-grounded technique for performance evaluation in sports analytics is Human Pose Estimation (HPE). Our focus is on real-time action recognition in combat sports like boxing. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are heavily parameterized, so can’t be used in real-time in any low-end devices. Apart from this, fine-grained classification in highly dynamic activities in sports are typically performed using sensors only. Our proposed Machine Learning based pipeline provides real-time fine-grained solution for 14 boxing punch types of classification using RGB video only. Our approach includes the implementation of three novel and generalized motion dynamics features that encode velocity as well as acceleration of the pose sequences., 1) Unified-Axis Angular Encoding (UAE), 2) 2D Motion Dynamics Descriptors (2DMDD), 3) Fifth-order Angular Encoding (FAE). We employed classical machine learning algorithms I.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to make a lightweight model and test it on YouTube videos. The average accuracies of pipeline using the proposed features are found to be 55%, 92% and 84% for UAE, 2DMDD, and FAE respectively. Using KNN, we have achieved 99% accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation by using FAE features. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195499056"

The degree of the happenings depends on the workplace environment setting and the incident regulatory measures implemented. By the nature of its work environment, the oil and gas upstream sector is susceptible to high incident rates. In the current fierce business competition and practices, improving productivity, quality, and other processes, such as Safety, is vital. Implementing well-designed safety procedures is the key to managing and reducing the risk level of workplace incidents. Methods: Recently, the application of Machine learning (ML) modeling for accident/injury prediction has been reported in the construction, mining, transport, and health sectors. Likewise, the objective of this paper was to implement three machine-learning-based models to predict injury rates in a drilling operation. The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway provided the datasets. First, the dataset was pre-processed, and then the selected features and target dataset were used for the modeling. Finally, the model prediction and performance accuracy analysis were performed. Results: Results showed that multivariable regression (MVR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms-based models predict the test data with R2 values of 0.9576, 0.793, and 0.97036, respectively. Conclusion: As the common saying goes, 'prevention is better than cure.' For this, implementing methods such as improved work processes and Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) mitigation procedures, workplace injuries, and accidents allow for reducing the risk level of workplace injuries. The application of integrated machine learning tools, along with carefully built-in workplace accident database implementation, will provide early detection and possible remedial precautions that can be taken to prevent workplace injuries/accidents/fatalities.

However, robust real-time activity recognition remains elusive for rapid-paced sports like table tennis due to the complexity of strokes and quick maneuvering. This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization. Our proposed model outperformed the latest models in this field with higher accuracy, recall values, F1-score, and precision. While expanding the dataset diversity and testing variations of deep network architectures could further enhance performance, this paper demonstrates a crucial leap toward helping real-time analytics in table tennis using an AI-powered computer vision approach.

Existing definitions for identifying hospital-acquired pressure injuries are inconsistent due to the lack of high-quality documentation surrounding pressure injuries. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an ensemble-based algorithm that leverages truth inference methods to resolve label inconsistencies between various case definitions and the level of disagreements in annotations.

However, the classification accuracy could be improved due to limitations in the existing method. Therefore, this study aimed to introduce and implement feature selection technique to identify key performance indicators in rugby league positional groups and assess the performances of six classification algorithms. Fifteen and fourteen of 157 performance indicators for backs and forwards were identified respectively as key performance indicators by the correlation-based feature selection method, with seven common indicators between the positional groups. Classification results show that models developed using the key performance indicators had improved performance for both positional groups than models developed using all performance indicators. 5-Nearest Neighbour produced the best classification accuracy for backs and forwards (accuracy = 85% and 77%) which is higher than the previous method’s accuracies.

The paper proposes a new deep learning-based prediction approach for One Day International (ODI) cricket, using Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with an attention mechanism. While traditional machine learning-based models have shown some promise, they still suffer from the inability to capture long-term dependencies within a cricket match sequential data. The LSTM architecture inherently tends to learn these temporal patterns really well; hence, it is particularly suited for this task. The attention mechanism further enhances this model, where the critical moments in the match are solely responsible for the outcome. Based on this, detection will be done with an extensive dataset covering more than matches of various cricket formats: ODI, T20I, and Test matches. The dataset is a collection from ESPNcricinfo and other official cricket databases, including ball-by-ball information with relevant contextual features: performance metrics from teams, player statistics, weather conditions, and venue information. With this great performance, it was much higher than the best performance of traditional machine learning approaches by as high as 94%.

Technological developments and the growing uses of human activity recognition (HAR) in various industries, including healthcare, sports analytics, and human-computer interface, are responsible for the growing interest. Deep learning techniques are the most promising of the different approaches to HAR because of their capacity to extract intricate patterns from enormous datasets. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing human activities utilizing 3D skeleton information. A wide range of human movements can be accurately recognized and categorized using this method, which makes use of deep learning's capabilities. The center parts of our approach are illustrated as Joint Position Scaling and Temporal Alignment. After normalization, the 3D skeleton data is represented in two different forms like Spatial Representation and Temporal Representation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been employed on the features extracted from the deep neural network to improve our model's classification accuracy. The output from the second last layer of the neural network is used to train the SVM, allowing it to draw a decision boundary that effectively divides movements of gait. Bayesian Optimization technique has been used to adjust each hyperparameter to make sure our model was resilient.

However, the efficiency of the CAE simulation development phase is low, resulting in a lengthy overall cycle. To better accommodate the increasingly shortened vehicle development cycles, this paper thoroughly explores the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting head injury in pedestrian protection. Based on 25 different vehicle models, key features at impact points were defined according to finite element simulation models and results, and a head injury database was constructed. Various machine learning algorithms were then used in a comparative study to identify the optimal predictive model. In tests with three randomly selected new vehicle models, the R2 values were approximately 0.7, with a maximum of 0.7456, and prediction times were within seconds, greatly enhancing prediction efficiency. This demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in safety performance development.

A large dataset of 14,146 serves from 97 Davis Cup doubles matches played between 2010 and 2019 was analyzed using explainable AI techniques. The angle and distance from the bounce to the sidelines of the serves were found to best distinguish the points won with aces from rallies lasting more than three strokes. Optimal serve angle ranges of 5.7–8.7° substantially increased the probability of serving an ace by over 80%, compared to around 30% when serving used more central angles. Lateral bounce distances of 0–28 cm from the sidelines also boosted the ace probability by over 50%. The serve speed was shown to have less influence on serve effectiveness as compared to singles tennis, with velocities above 187 km h−1 only increasing the probability of serving an ace by 10%. These findings have important practical implications for the tactical decision-making and technical training of serves in men’s professional doubles tennis. The data highlight that the angle and placement of serves are more important than velocity for attaining effective serves in doubles. Coaches and players can use this knowledge to pay special attention to the most important variables in the effectiveness of serves, such as the line distance and angle, in order to maximize the performance of the doubles serve.

Methods: From a database of 6,010 patients undergoing M3M surgery, 25 patients met the inclusion criteria of bilateral M3M removal with postoperative unilateral IAN injury. In this within-patient controlled trial, preoperative PANO and CBCT images were available, while 3D-AI models of the mandibular canal and teeth were generated from the CBCT images using the Virtual Patient Creator AI platform (Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium). Five examiners, who were blinded to surgical outcomes, assessed the imaging modalities and assigned scores indicating the risk level of IAN injury (high, medium, or low risk). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) for IAN risk assessment were calculated for each imaging modality. Results: For IAN injury risk assessment after M3M removal, sensitivity was 0.87 for 3D-AI, 0.89 for CBCT versus 0.73 for PANO. Furthermore, the AUC and specificity values were 0.63 and 0.39 for 3D-AI, 0.58 and 0.28 for CBCT, and 0.57 and 0.41 for PANO, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the imaging modalities for any diagnostic parameters. Conclusion: This within-patient controlled trial study revealed that risk assessment for IAN injury after M3M removal was rather similar for 3D-AI, PANO, and CBCT, with a sensitivity for injury prediction reaching up to 0.87 for 3D-AI and 0.89 for CBCT. Clinical significance: This within-patient trial is pioneering in exploring the application of 3D AI-driven models for assessing IAN injury risk after M3M removal. The present results indicate that AI-powered 3D models based on CBCT might facilitate IAN risk assessment of M3M removal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177805619"

A significant challenge during the pandemic has not only been the accurate detection of positive cases but also the efficient prediction of risks associated with complications and patient survival probabilities. These tasks entail considerable clinical resource allocation and attention. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net Biochem, a versatile and explainable framework for constructing machine learning models. We apply this framework to predict COVID-19 patient survival and the likelihood of developing Acute Kidney Injury during hospitalization, utilizing clinical and biochemical data in a transparent, systematic approach. The proposed approach advances machine learning model design by seamlessly integrating domain expertise with explainability tools, enabling model decisions to be based on key biomarkers. This fosters a more transparent and interpretable decision-making process made by machines specifically for medical applications. More specifically, the framework comprises two phases: In the first phase, referred to as the “clinician-guided design” phase, the dataset is preprocessed using explainable AI and domain expert input. To better demonstrate this phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully curated clinical and biochemical markers based on clinician assessments for survival and kidney injury prediction in COVID-19 patients. This dataset was selected from a patient cohort of 1366 individuals at Stony Brook University. Moreover, we designed and trained a diverse collection of machine learning models, encompassing gradient-based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures, specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the selected markers. In the second phase, called the “explainability-driven design refinement” phase, the proposed framework employs explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding of each model’s decision-making process but also to identify the overall impact of individual clinical and biochemical markers for bias identification. In this context, we used the models constructed in the previous phase for the prediction task and analyzed the explainability outcomes alongside a clinician with over 8 years of experience to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical validity of the decisions made. The explainability-driven insights obtained, in conjunction with the associated clinical feedback, are then utilized to guide and refine the training policies and architectural design iteratively. This process aims to enhance not only the prediction performance but also the clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Employing the proposed explainability-driven framework, we attained 93.55% accuracy in survival prediction and 88.05% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complications. The models have been made available through an open-source platform. Although not a production-ready solution, this study aims to serve as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, and citizen scientists to develop innovative and trustworthy clinical decision support solutions, ultimately assisting clinicians worldwide in managing pandemic outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173644910"

However, such an approach cannot provide specific instructions or facilitate immediate feedback for improvement of the shooting motion. In this article, a method is presented to quantitatively evaluate four key action indicators of shooting basketballs using a machine-learning model based on Bayesian optimization of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). Important motion data for the model are collected by micro-inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment. The LightGBM model is then developed for the regression prediction of the four action indicators of shooting. In the results, it is indicated that for an individual player, the highest correlation scores of the four indexes range from 97.6% to 99.3%. The proposed approach for quantitatively assessing shooting indexes can provide objective and data-based guidance to improve players’ shooting performance. Foreseeably, the prediction model can be embedded into a chip of a wearable device to evaluate the real-time shot quality quantitatively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172147027"

These minor details might sometimes escape human notice. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders, who developed a computer algorithm recently that can assess any discomfort associated with sports. These little things can occasionally elude human vision. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders. This work is based on an exploratory investigation of AI applications in team games. The project's purpose is to look at the existing and potential applications of AI in team sports performance monitoring. The study also looked at the constraints of employing AI.

Accurate prediction of hepatotoxic compounds is crucial for safe drug development. Several DILI prediction models have been published, but they are built on different data sets, making it difficult to compare model performance. Moreover, most existing models are based on molecular fingerprints or descriptors, neglecting molecular geometric properties and lacking interpretability. To address these limitations, we developed GeoDILI, an interpretable graph neural network that uses a molecular geometric representation. First, we utilized a geometry-based pretrained molecular representation and optimized it on the DILI data set to improve predictive performance. Second, we leveraged gradient information to obtain high-precision atomic-level weights and deduce the dominant substructure. We benchmarked GeoDILI against recently published DILI prediction models, as well as popular GNN models and fingerprint-based machine learning models using the same data set, showing superior predictive performance of our proposed model. We applied the interpretable method in the DILI data set and derived seven precise and mechanistically elucidated structural alerts. Overall, GeoDILI provides a promising approach for accurate and interpretable DILI prediction with potential applications in drug discovery and safety assessment.

Based on the above, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sports management system to enhance work efficiency and ease of physical education teachers and coaches. It aims to make an in-depth study on the construction of sports performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining; later, it includes the construction of sports management systems. This paper operates in such a way that it first discusses the sports performance management and physical analysis system's construction. Second, it analyses the overall framework structure of the system by presenting a detailed description of the sports test management and test items management. In addition, it analyses sports performance management and sports performance, system management and physical performance and other functional modules contained in the system along with the database design in the system based on C4.5 that is then used as the Decision Tree (DT) Classifier for data mining. Third, it uses sports performance management of DT, and the physical analysis algorithm uses the data information gained to select the split attributes. Fourth, it divides the sports performance training data set into multiple sub-datasets to construct the performance management and physical analysis system based on data mining. Finally, the suggested system is compared with existing approaches and obtains an accuracy of 97%, which is 27% high than the selected approaches. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has high accuracy in data mining related to sports performance and can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of physical education teachers.

Ski injuries are rare events, but they carry a high cost, that is, can cause working or movement disabilities. Usually, ski risk assessment is performed on small-scale, case-controlled studies where the effect of a single factor is evaluated. Recently, data mining and machine learning algorithms are being employed for ski risk assessment and injury prediction. However, these models do not generally satisfy the need for interpretation of the decision model, do not provide explanations for the predictions, and in general do not ensure the completeness and consistency of decision rules. To make data mining and machine learning models useful, one needs to implement the aforementioned properties. Decision support systems are expected to have these properties; however, the process of building such decision support systems is still tedious: it has to consider human biases, assumptions, and subjective values, as well as focus on the decision problem being solved. We propose a method for extraction of decision models from data at hand. Our method DIDEX, Data Induced DEcision eXpert, builds models that have desirable properties for inclusion in decision support systems. The proposed method is used to build a decision model for ski injury prediction based on data from Mt. Kopaonik ski resort, Serbia. The results show that DIDEX generates up to a five times simpler model compared to the existing domain expert DEX models while having a 6% better predictive accuracy. Additionally, its predictive accuracy is comparable to similar machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree classifiers, random forest, and logistic regression. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145422295"

However, the application of deep learning to improve badminton athletes' performance faces challenges related to identifying weaknesses, generating winning suggestions, and validating strategy effectiveness. These challenges arise due to the limited availability of realistic environments and agents. This paper aims to address these research gaps and make contributions to the badminton community. To achieve this goal, we propose a closed-loop approach consisting of six key components: Badminton Data Acquisition, Imitating Players' Styles, Simulating Matches, Optimizing Strategies, Training Execution, and Real-World Competitions. Specifically, we developed a novel model called RallyNet, which excels at imitating players' styles, allowing agents to accurately replicate real players' behavior. Secondly, we created a sophisticated badminton simulation environment that incorporates real-world physics, faithfully recreating game situations. Thirdly, we employed reinforcement learning techniques to improve players' strategies, enhancing their chances of winning while preserving their unique playing styles. By comparing strategy differences before and after improvement, we provide winning suggestions to players, which can be validated against diverse opponents within our carefully designed environment. Lastly, through collaborations with badminton venues and players, we apply the generated suggestions to the players' training and competitions, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we continuously gather data from training and competitions, incorporating it into the closed-loop cycle to refine strategies and suggestions.

The objective of this study was to build prediction models for falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling older adults in China. Methods: This study used data (Waves 2015 and 2018) from 5,818 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A total of 107 input variables at the baseline level were regarded as candidate features. Five machine learning algorithms were used to build the 3-year fall and fall-related injury risk prediction models. SHapley Additive exPlanations was used for the prediction model explanation. Analyses were conducted in 2022. Results: The logistic regression model achieved the best performance among fall and fall-related injury prediction models with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.739 and 0.757, respectively. Experience of falling was the most important feature in both models. Other important features included basic activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, depressive symptoms, house tidiness, grip strength, and sleep duration. The important features unique to the fall model were house temperature, sex, and flush toilets, whereas lung function, smoking, and Internet access were exclusively related to the fall-related injury model.

The aim of the present study was to i) determine the feasibility of and adherence to our monitoring approach, and ii) identify variables associated with up-coming illness and injury. We incorporated a comprehensive set of monitoring tools consisting of external load and physical fitness data, questionnaires, blood, neuromuscular-, hamstring, hip abductor and hip adductor performance tests performed over a three-month period in elite under-18 academy soccer players. Twenty-five players (age: 16.6 ± 0.9 years, height: 178 ± 7 cm, weight: 74 ± 7 kg, VO<inf>2max</inf>: 59 ± 4 ml/min/kg) took part in the study. In addition to evaluating adherence to the monitoring approach, data were analyzed using a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict illness and injuries. The approach was feasible, with no injuries or dropouts due to the monitoring pro-cess. Questionnaire adherence was high at the beginning and de-creased steadily towards the end of the study. An SVM resulted in the best classification results for three classification tasks, i.e., illness prediction, illness determination and injury prediction. For injury prediction, one of four injuries present in the test data set was detected, with 96.3% of all data points (i.e., injuries and non-injuries) correctly detected. For both illness prediction and deter-mination, there was only one illness in the test data set that was detected by the linear SVM. However, the model showed low pre-cision for injury and illness prediction with a considerable num-ber of false-positives. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a holistic monitoring approach with the possibility of predicting illness and injury. Additional data points are needed to improve the prediction models. In practical application, this may lead to over-cautious recommendations on when players should be protected from injury and illness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170652286"

Liver injury is one of the most extensively studied endpoints due to its severity and frequency, occurring among populations that consume drugs or dietary supplements. In this review, we focus on recent developments of in silico modeling for liver injury prediction using deep learning and in vitro data based on adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Despite these models being mainly developed using datasets generated from drug-like molecules, they were also applied to the prediction of hepatotoxicity caused by herbal products. As deep learning has achieved great success in many different fields, advanced machine learning algorithms have been actively applied to improve the accuracy of in silico models. Additionally, the development of liver AOPs, combined with big data in toxicology, has been valuable in developing in silico models with enhanced predictive performance and interpretability. Specifically, one approach involves developing structure-based models for predicting molecular initiating events of liver AOPs, while others use in vitro data with structure information as model inputs for making predictions. Even though liver injury remains a difficult endpoint to predict, advancements in machine learning algorithms and the expansion of in vitro databases with relevant biological knowledge have made a huge impact on improving in silico modeling for drug-induced liver injury prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165604184"

These techniques enable sports analysts to evaluate player performance more effectively. A literature review of player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A novel framework was proposed to evaluate batsman strength based on individual performance, role in the team, and team interactions. Traditionally, proposed ranking systems are derived from static networks, that is, the aggregation of game results over time. However, the scores of the players (or teams) fluctuate over time. Intuitively, defeating a renowned player during peak performance is more rewarding than defeating the same player during other periods. To account for this, we propose a new method and apply it to the T20 format Indian Premier League. The method serves three main purposes: First, it creates a new performance index for players to rank them more accurately and effectively. Second, the players are clustered based on their expertise. In the third phase, a social network analysis approach is applied to visualize and analyze crickets as a network to gain better insights into players’ team interactions. This novel approach is a helpful index for sports coaches, analysts, cricket fans, and managers to evaluate player performance and rank for future aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165330752"

Therefore, early prediction of AKI in patients with trauma is important for risk stratification and the provision of optimal intensive care unit treatment. This study aimed to compare 2 models, machine learning (ML) techniques and logistic regression, in predicting AKI in patients with trauma. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 400 patients who sustained torso injuries between January 2016 and June 2020. Patients were included if they were aged > 15 years, admitted to the intensive care unit, survived for > 48 hours, had thoracic and/or abdominal injuries, had no end-stage renal disease, and had no missing data. AKI was defined in accordance with the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition and staging system. The patients were divided into 2 groups: AKI (n = 78) and non-AKI (n = 322). We divided the original dataset into a training (80%) and a test set (20%), and the logistic regression with stepwise selection and ML (decision tree with hyperparameter optimization using grid search and cross-validation) was used to build a model for predicting AKI. The models established using the training dataset were evaluated using a confusion matrix receiver operating characteristic curve with the test dataset. We included 400 patients with torso injury, of whom 78 (19.5%) progressed to AKI. Age, intestinal injury, cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours, and the use of vasopressors were independent risk factors for AKI in the logistic regression model. In the ML model, vasopressors were the most important feature, followed by cumulative fluid balance within 24 hours and packed red blood cell transfusion within 4 hours. The accuracy score showed no differences between the 2 groups; however, the recall and F1 score were significantly higher in the ML model (.94 vs 56 and.75 vs 64, respectively). The ML model performed better than the logistic regression model in predicting AKI in patients with trauma. ML techniques can aid in risk stratification and the provision of optimal care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168524297"

However, one of the major challenges is the difficulty of automated acquisition of continuous movement data during sports matches. In particular, it is a conundrum to reliably track a tiny ball on a wide soccer pitch with obstacles such as occlusion and imitations. Tackling the problem, this paper proposes an inference framework of ball trajectory from player trajectories as a cost-efficient alternative to ball tracking. We combine Set Transformers to get permutation-invariant and equivariant representations of the multi-agent contexts with a hierarchical architecture that intermediately predicts the player ball possession to support the final trajectory inference. Also, we introduce the reality loss term and postprocessing to secure the estimated trajectories to be physically realistic. The experimental results show that our model provides natural and accurate trajectories as well as admissible player ball possession at the same time. Lastly, we suggest several practical applications of our framework including missing trajectory imputation, semi-automated pass annotation, automated zoom-in for match broadcasting, and calculating possession-wise running performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171349345"

It contributes to exciting and unpredictable play, which can help teams to overcome defensive strategies and create scoring opportunities. Consequently, evaluating the creative abilities of players is an important aspect of the player recruitment process. However, there is currently no clear way to measure creativity in soccer. It is not captured by the typical result-based performance indicators, as being creative entails going beyond just doing something useful, to accomplishing something useful but in a unique or atypical way. Therefore in this paper, we define a novel metric to quantify the level of creativity involved in a player's passes. Our Creative Decision Rating (CDR) utilizes machine learning techniques to assess two important factors: the originality of a pass, and its value in terms of increasing the team's chances of scoring a goal. We validated our metric on StatsBomb 360 contextual event stream data of the 2021/22 English Premier League season and show through a number of use cases that it provides another angle on a player's skill, complementing existing player evaluation metrics. Overall, our metric provides a concise method for capturing and quantifying the creativity of soccer players and could have important implications for player recruitment and talent development in the sport. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171338042"

This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and women's singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players' tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164887421"

As this problem has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing work on representing strategic relations among players’ shot types and movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion for Movement Forecasting model (DyMF) with interaction style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and between both players within a rally, and dynamic players’ tactics across time. In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods and demonstrate the practical usage of movement forecasting.

Method: During the 2022 European Championships in Munich (Germany), all registered athletes, coaches, and health professionals were asked to complete an online questionnaire on their perception and beliefs of injury prediction use as an injury risk reduction measure. The agreement on the interest, intent to use, perceived help and potential stress, were assessed using an analogic scale from 0 (i.e. not at all) to 100 (i.e. totally). Results: We collected a total of 79 responses: 35 athletes, 14 coaches, and 29 health professionals, from 23 countries. They all expressed a high level of agreement regarding the interest (86 ± 15), intent to use (84 ± 16), and perceived help (85 ± 16) of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure. Regarding potential stress induced by injury prediction, the level of agreement was moderate (41 ± 33), and there was an important inter-individual variability in each stakeholder group (athletes, coaches, health professionals). Conclusions: This was the first study investigating the perception and beliefs of elite athletics athletes, coaches, and health professionals regarding the use of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure. Regardless of the stakeholders, there was a high level of acceptance reported in this potential measure. These findings have important implications for future research and in practice in the use of injury prediction as an injury risk reduction measure in elite athletics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153950241"

One of the strategies for hamstring injury prevention is the identification of high-risk athletes. In this article, we implemented machine learning algorithms for injury risk estimation in 284 male footballers playing in 16 professional or semi-professional football teams from 3 countries. The predictors (input data) of the algorithms consisted of an athlete's baseline dataset, including hamstring injury history in the previous season and data measured during a maximum sprint of 30 m. The output data, binary, was the occurrence of hamstring injury. The three models used, logistic regression, random forests and AdaBoost, were compared to a dummy classifier. The results showed that it is possible, to a certain extent, to predict the occurrence of injury with these models. The comparison with the dummy classifier, when considering a set of metrics including F1-score, showed the interest of the three models used. Additionally, the relative importance of predictors can be measured, which can aid in understanding the predominant factors influencing injury.

Material and Methods: Fifty-six elite male youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years; height: 179 ± 8 cm; mass: 70.4 ± 9.2 kg) performed a 3D motion analysis, postural control testing, and strength testing. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to identify the most important injury predictors. Predictive performance of the LASSO model was determined in a leave-one-out (LOO) prediction competition. Results: Twenty-three non-contact injuries were registered. The LASSO model identified concentric knee extensor peak torque, hip transversal plane moment in the single-leg drop landing task and center of pressure sway in the single-leg stance test as the three most important predictors for injury in that order. The LASSO model was able to predict injury outcomes with a likelihood of 58% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.63 (sensitivity = 35%; specificity = 79%). Conclusion: The three most important variables for predicting the injury outcome suggest the importance of neuromuscular and biomechanical performance measures in elite youth soccer. These preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and planning, as well as for the development of customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors. However, the poor predictive performance of the final model confirms the challenge of predicting sports injuries, and the model must therefore be evaluated in larger samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147513540"

For appropriate recommendations to the team management and the team players, there is a need to predict the match and quantify the important factors for which prediction models need to be developed. The second thing required is identifying talented and emerging players and performing an associative analysis of the important factors to the match-winning outcome. This paper formulates a hybrid machine learning-clustering-associative rules model. This paper also implements the framework for cricket matches, one of the most popular sports globally watched by billions around the world. We predict the match outcome for One day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty 20 s (T20s) (two formats of Cricket representing fifty over and twenty over versions respectively) adopting state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep neural networks. The variable importance is computed using machine-learning techniques and further statistically validated through the regression model. The emerging talented players are identified by clustering. Association rules are generated for determining the best possible winning outcome. The results show that environmental conditions are equally crucial for determining a match result, as are internal quantitative factors. The model is thus helpful for both team management and for players to improve their winning strategy and also for discovering emerging players to form an unbeatable team. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125772148"

Nevertheless, the early talent identification of these riders largely remains a subjective assessment. Therefore, an analytical system which automatically detects talented riders based on their freely available youth results should be installed. However, such a system cannot be copied directly from related fields, as large distinctions are observed between cycling and other sports. The aim of this paper is to develop such a data analytical system, which leverages the unique features of each race and thereby focusses on feature engineering, data quality, and visualization. To facilitate the deployment of prediction algorithms in situations without complete cases, we propose an adaptation to the k-nearest neighbours imputation algorithm which uses expert knowledge. Overall, our proposed method correlates strongly with eventual rider performance and can aid scouts in targeting young talents.

The emerging practice of medicine and public health supported by electronic processes and communication in sports medicine represents an opportunity for developing new injury risk reduction strategies. Modelling and predicting the risk of injury in real-time through artificial intelligence using machine learning techniques might represent an innovative injury risk reduction strategy. Thus, the primary aim of this study will be to analyse the relationship between the level of Injury Risk Estimation Feedback (I-REF) use (average score of athletes' self-declared level of I-REF consideration for their athletics activity) and the ICPR burden during an athletics season. Method and analysis We will conduct a prospective cohort study, called Injury Prediction with Artificial Intelligence (IPredict-AI), over one 38-week athletics season (from September 2022 to July 2023) involving competitive athletics athletes licensed with the French Federation of Athletics. All athletes will be asked to complete daily questionnaires on their athletics activity, their psychological state, their sleep, the level of I-REF use and any ICPR. I-REF will present a daily estimation of the ICPR risk ranging from 0% (no risk for injury) to 100% (maximal risk for injury) for the following day. All athletes will be free to see I-REF and to adapt their athletics activity according to I-REF. The primary outcome will be the ICPR burden over the follow-up (over an athletics season), defined as the number of days lost from training and/or competition due to ICPR per 1000 hours of athletics activity. The relationship between ICPR burden and the level of I-REF use will be explored by using linear regression models. Ethics and dissemination This prospective cohort study was reviewed and approved by the Saint-Etienne University Hospital Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board: IORG0007394, IRBN1062022/CHUSTE).

We use competition and training data of three world-class cyclists of Team Jumbo–Visma to construct personalised heart rate models that relate the heart rate during exercise to the pedal power signal. Our model captures the non-trivial dependency between exertion and corresponding response of the heart rate, which we show can be effectively estimated by an exponential kernel. To construct the daily heart rate models that are required for day-to-day fitness estimation, we aggregate all sessions in the previous week and apply sampling. On average, the explained variance of our models is 0.86, which we demonstrate is more than twice as large as for models that ignore the temporal integration involved in the heart’s response to exercise. We show that the fitness of a cyclist can be monitored by tracking developments of parameters of our heart rate models. In particular, we monitor the decay constant of the kernel involved, and also analytically determine virtual aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. We demonstrate that our findings for the virtual anaerobic threshold on average agree with the results of exercise tests. We believe this work is an important step forward in performance optimization by opening up avenues for switching to adaptive training programs that take into account the current physiological state of an athlete. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144155452"

In terms of CID global impact, around 1.7 billion people were affected in the last decade, and in 2020 alone, 30 million people were displaced due to CID. Furthermore, over the past two decades, 1 million deaths were reported and over $1.7 trillion in damage was attributed to CID. As such, the World Economic Forum, in its 2022 report, has identified climate action failure and extreme weather as the two most severe global risks to be considered over the next decade. Given the uncertainty and complexity associated with predicting CID frequencies and related impacts, the use of descriptive-, predictive- and prescriptive data analytics is key. To demonstrate the power of data analytics in predicting CID impacts, this work focuses on developing a data-driven machine learning model that predicts tornado-induced injuries based on a diverse set of input features ranging from hazard-, social-, geographic-, and climate-related features together with attributes related to community vulnerability, risk and resilience. These input features are then used to train and test various machine learning-based prediction models utilizing diverse techniques including decision trees, ensemble methods, and artificial neural networks. These models are subsequently evaluated to select the most significant features and the best performing model. In addition, several variable importance techniques are used to evaluate the dominance of all features and develop a model considering the most influential features. The results show that the best performing model had a testing accuracy of 83%.

Transportation agencies and researchers have been continuously making an effort to ensure minimal error margins in the road system. There is a growing interest in the Southeast Michigan region because of the active role of original equipment manufacturers in spurring research in the new mobility field and autonomous vehicle technology. As new jobs are created and commuting trips increase, traffic safety becomes even more important. Thus, this study presents one of the first efforts to study crash patterns for Southeast Michigan using machine learning models to analyze and predict crash severity in the region based on various contributing factors. We combine a three-step method of correlation analysis, machine learning predictive models, and spatial analysis to develop a rigid schema for crash prediction. Results show that decision tree classifiers provide accurate predictions and rapid computations. Also, spatial plots of predicted injury severities reveal disproportionate errors in model predictions at intersections prompting the need to stratify the crash data for further analyses. This significantly improves severe injury predictions at non-intersection locations and highlights pedestrians as a main important feature. The converse holds for intersections that identify motorcycles as the main feature for severity prediction.

The increment of the prediction ability is nowadays mandatory to reduce the high number of false positives. The aim of this study was to investigate if players’ blood sample profiles could increase the predictive ability of the models trained only on external training workloads. Method: Eighteen elite soccer players competing in Italian league (Serie B) during the seasons 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 took part in this study. Players’ blood samples parameters (i.e., Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, ferritin, and sideremia) were recorded through the two soccer seasons to group them into two main groups using a non-supervised ML algorithm (k-means). Additionally to external workloads data recorded every training or match day using a GPS device (K-GPS 10 Hz, K-Sport International, Italy), this grouping was used as a predictor for injury risk. The goodness of ML models trained were tested to assess the influence of blood sample profile to injury prediction. Results: Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, number of red blood cells, testosterone, and ferritin were the most important features that allowed to profile players and to analyze the response to external workloads for each type of player profile. Players’ blood samples’ characteristics permitted to personalize the decision-making rules of the ML models based on external workloads reaching an accuracy of 63%. This approach increased the injury prediction ability of about 15% compared to models that take into consideration only training workloads’ features. The influence of each external workload varied in accordance with the players’ blood sample characteristics and the physiological demands of a specific period of the season. Conclusion: Field experts should hence not only monitor the external workloads to assess the status of the players, but additional information derived from individuals’ characteristics permits to have a more complete overview of the players well-being. In this way, coaches could better personalize the training program maximizing the training effect and minimizing the injury risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129845045"

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However, converting the sensor information to 3-D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Toward solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), encoder-decoder networks, and ResNets to extract 3-D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3-D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. In addition, this article validates the feasibility of mirrored bilateral training approach with applications in prosthetic devices. Finally, NeuroPose is comprehensively evaluated on both low-end and recent smartphones with a processing latency of 0.019 s and low energy overhead. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144083351"

The purpose of this analysis was to create decision-making models based on data collected during both training and match, which will enable the preparation of a tool to model the load and report the increased risk of injury for a given player in the upcoming microcycle.

This study aims to investigate the injury severity prediction (ISP) capability in machine-learning analytics based on five-different regional Level 1 trauma center enrolled patients in Korea. We study car crash-related injury data of 1417 patients enrolled in the Korea In-Depth Accident Study database from January 2011 to April 2021. Severe injury classification was defined using an Injury Severity Score of 15 or greater. A planar crash was considered by excluding rollovers to compromise an accurate prediction. Furthermore, dissimilarities of the collision partner component based on vehicle segmentation were assumed for crash incompatibility. To handle class-imbalanced clinical datasets, we used four data-sampling techniques (i.e., class-weighting, resampling, synthetic minority oversampling, and adaptive synthetic sampling). Machine-learning analytics based on logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a multilayer perceptron model were used for the evaluations. Each model was executed using five-fold cross-validation to solve overfitting consistent with the hyperparameters tuned to improve model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.896. Additionally, the present ISP model showed an under-triage rate of 6.1%. The Delta-V, age and Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) were significant predictors. The results demonstrated that the data-balanced XGBoost model achieved a reliable performance on injury severity classification of emergency department patients.

A fundamental yet understudied problem in this area is finding an optimal data representation for processing athlete trajectories using machine learning algorithms. In the present work, we address this gap by discussing common representations in use and propose Tactical Graphs, an alternative graph-based format capable of producing integrative, contextualized models for machine learning applications. We provide an in-depth, domain-specific motivation of the proposed data representation scheme and show how this approach exploits inherent data traits. We propose Tactical Graph Networks (TGNets), a light-weight, hybrid machine learning architecture sensitive to player interactions. Our method is evaluated with an extensive ablation study and the first comprehensive state of the art comparison between standard feature, state vector, and image-based methods on the same dataset. Experiments were conducted using real-world football data containing short sequences of defensive play labelled according to the outcome of ball winning attempts. The results indicate that TGNets are on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models while exhibiting only a fraction of their complexity. We further demonstrate that selecting the right data representation is crucial as it has a significant influence on model performance.

The interconnectivity of data acquisition devices with an AI-assisted computing platform in the Nx-IoT environment will not only allow the spectators to track the formation of their favorite players during a soccer match but will also enable the managerial staff to evaluate the players' performance in the soccer match as well as in practice sessions.

Clubs also suffer when key players are injured; their game tactics may need to be changed to better fit the limited team members available, which can severely affect performance, especially in competitive leagues. The goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a large dataset to train an accurate Machine Learning model to predict injuries in professional-level soccer. Machine Learning algorithms used to solve this problem have historically had small datasets, which are prone to variance and unreliable results. Therefore, a larger dataset will be constructed from publicly available data to prove that a reliable injury prediction tool can be created. The data in this study will span multiple years and include data about player minutes, age, appearances, and whether they were recovering from an injury. The results of the study show that an injury prediction tool using Machine Learning is practical for use in professional-level soccer to help teams predict and prevent non-contact injuries sustained by athletes. Further, the quality of these Machine Learning tools will increase as more accurate data collection technology is acquired by teams. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190141790"

With the popularity of wearable devices and the development of data science, machine learning is being introduced into the field of sports injury prevention, providing a new perspective for the prevention of sports injury. To assist students in understanding the safety aspects of soccer sports, addressing the potential risks associated with competition and confrontation in soccer activities, and providing guidance for students to engage in exercise safely and healthily, this paper presents a systematical injury risk analysis and injury prediction model based on machine learning algorithms for campus soccer players. The proposed data-driven soccer sports injury prediction algorithm is based on sufficient exercise data collection, and the risk of sports injury in the future training cycle is predicted based on the characteristic attributes of key exercise load. Based on the experimental results, the proposed Support Vector Machine based algorithm can accurately predict the injury, and the accuracy is close to 94%.

However, no machine learning model has emerged which has good performance and generalisability to multiple datasets. Focusing on explainable machine learning, this paper discusses possible limitations in common approaches to injury prediction, and investigates methods that might be able to overcome these limitations. In particular, we first examine the value that can be obtained by including daily records of psychological variables to provide a multi-modal perspective on athletes. Secondly, we consider whether models that focus on learning from local rather than global patterns in the data are better suited to modelling injuries. We explain how the diversity of injuries in terms of severity, duration, type (chronic versus acute) and context may make local models preferable. The local modelling approaches we consider include subgroup discovery, anomaly detection and casebased classification. Since the proposed approaches threaten to increase the model complexity, we take great care to ensure that explainability is maintained, and describe the ways in which each of our methods is explainable. This leads to a set of explainable, local models. To provide an empirical basis for the investigations, we perform a series of computational studies using data obtained by daily recording of professional association football players in the Netherlands over a period of two seasons. These studies aim to expand the currently limited literature on applying explainable ML methods to injury prediction. Our results indicate that predicting injuries is very difficult in general, while the focus of this paper is mainly on providing insights on explainability and interpretability. Therefore, alongside results detailing the performance of various machine learning models, we also include multiple examples of explanations that can be extracted using our proposed methods, which may support actionability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186144825"

In recent years, sports analytics has gained significant attention, aiming to extract valuable insights from large volumes of cricket data. Cricket has many fans in India. With a strong fan following, many try to use their cricket intuition to predict the outcome of a match. A set of rules and a points system govern the game. The venue and the performance of each player greatly affect the outcome of the match. The game is difficult to predict accurately as the various components are closely related. The CRR (Current Run Rate) approach is used to predict the final score of the first innings of a cricket match. Total points are calculated by multiplying the average number of runs scored in each over by the total number of overs. For ODI cricket, these methods are useless as the game can change very quickly regardless of the current run rate. The game may be decided by 1 or 2 overs. For more accurate score predictions, a system is needed that can more accurately predict the outcome of an inning. This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict scores and classify players based on their roles in the squad. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising various attributes of cricket matches, including player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest regression models are employed to predict scores. Additionally, player categorization is performed using a classification approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in enhancing performance analysis and decision-making in the game of cricket. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184821608"

Recently, AI has been introduced to the sports domain including the football (soccer) industry with applications in injury prediction and tactical analysis. However, the fact remains that the more complex an AI model is, the less explainable it becomes. Its black-box nature makes it difficult for human operators to understand its results, interpret its decisions and ultimately trust the model itself. This problem is magnified when the decisions and results suggested by an AI model affect the functioning of complex and multi-layered systems and entities, with a football club being such an example. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged for making an AI model more explainable, understandable and interpretable, thus assisting the creation of human-centered AI models.

As the core of the system, the driver injury prediction model can predict the driver's injury category in time and send the injury situation to the emergency medical institution. The medical institution arranges the optimal rescue team and hospital according to the injury situation obtained by the algorithm, which greatly reduces the economic loss and mortality caused by the accident. This paper mainly studies the severity of driver injury. Using the annual data from 2019 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), from which 10 variables such as driver injury, driver age and height were extracted, and the correlation between each independent variable and dependent variable was analyzed to increase the reliability and prediction accuracy of the network model adopted in this paper. In this paper, the combination of genetic algorithm and BP neural network was used to build a driver injury prediction model with machine learning. Compared with support vector machines (SVM), long short-term memory (LSTM), traditional BP neural network and logistic linear model, the accuracy was improved by 11.78%, 6.54%, 7.08% and 13.78% respectively. The research results can be used to improve the algorithm and performance of the enterprise call center in the advanced vehicle collision automatic call system, and finally can effectively improve the efficiency of accident rescue. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174264960"

The present study proposes an artificial intelligence solution for acute kidney injury prediction in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: Data were collected from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, area under the precision–recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. Results: Logistic regression, XGBoost, and XGBoost with severity scores were used to predict acute kidney injury risk using all features. The XGBoost-based acute kidney injury predictive models including XGBoost and XGBoost+severity scores model showed greater accuracy, recall, precision AUC, AUC-PR, and F1 score compared to logistic regression.

And the action plan has been formulated, and it is pointed out that it is necessary to deeply integrate the real economy and artificial intelligence, the Internet and digital China, as well as the smart society and big data. As the most critical part of community governance, the complexity and difficulty of community sports center governance is relatively high. Therefore, one of the key goals that all sectors of society are currently concerned about is how to build and develop community sports through more advanced technical means center. The innovative governance community sports center must effectively combine and integrate the current advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data, so that the level of community governance can be effectively improved. This paper draws on the academic background of 'governance' in the field of public management. Different from social management, 'governance' mainly reflects the administrative aspect, the cooperation between the government and all sectors of society, while the traditional social management mainly highlights the state's administrative management. It reflects the concept that the government's management power is inviolable and unshareable, which is also very different from the development direction of the gradual liberalization of the administrative power advocated by the Chinese government. Therefore, the effective way to solve various social problems at this stage is to change the concept of social management to community governance, and this approach has also been supported and valued by the government in recent years. The research shows that the management efficiency of community sports facilities can be effectively improved by optimizing the community sports governance system, making full use of the convenience brought by information resources, and using its own advanced technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169502928"

To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters, it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the 2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161463130"

Although practitioners have conducted many studies on the relationship between physical fitness and the likelihood of injury, the relationship between the two remains indeterminate. Consequently, this study utilized machine learning to preliminary investigate the relationship between individual physical fitness tests and injury risk, aiming to identify whether patterns of physical fitness change have an impact on injury risk. Methods: This study conducted a retrospective analysis by extracting the records of 17 young female basketball players from the sport-specific physical fitness monitoring and injury registration database in Fujian Province. Sports-specific physical fitness tests included physical performance, physiological, biochemical, and subjective perceived responses. The data for each player was standardized individually using Z-scores. Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques and edited nearest neighbor algorithms were used to sample the training set to address the negative impact of class imbalance on model performance. Feature extraction was performed on the dataset using linear discriminant analysis, and the prediction model was constructed using the cost-sensitive neural network. Results: The 10 replicate 5-fold stratified cross-validation showed that the lower limb non-contact injury prediction model based on the cost-sensitive neural network had achieved good discrimination and calibration (average Precision: 0.6360; average Recall: 0.8700; average F2-Score: 0.7980; average AUC: 0.8590; average Brier-score: 0.1020), which could be well applied in training practice. According to the attribution analysis, agility and speed were important physical attributes that affect youth female basketball players’ non-contact lower limb injury risk. Specifically, there was enhance in the performance of the 1-min double under, accompanied by an increase in urinary ketone and urinary blood levels following the agility test. The 3/4 basketball court sprint performance improved, while urinary protein and RPE levels decreased after the speed test. Conclusion: The sport-specific physical fitness change pattern can impact the lower limb non-contact injury risk of young female basketball players in Fujian Province, specifically in terms of agility and speed. These findings will provide valuable insights for planning athletes’ physical training programs, managing fatigue, and preventing injuries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160071249"

The aim of this inquiry was to conceive a machine learning model that can recognize preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative high-risk factors and predict the onset of myocardial injury following CME. Patients and Methods: This study included 1198 colon cancer patients, 133 of whom experienced myocardial injury after surgery. Thirty-six distinct variables were gathered, encompassing patient demographics, medical history, preoperative examination character-istics, surgery type, and intraoperative details. Four machine learning algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), were employed to fabricate the model, and k-fold cross-validation, ROC curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and external validation were employed to evaluate it. Results: Out of the four predictive models employed, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best performance. The ROC curve findings indicated that the XGBoost model exhibited remarkable predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.997 in the training set and 0.956 in the validation set. For internal validation, the k-fold cross-validation method was utilized, and the XGBoost model was shown to be steady. Furthermore, the calibration curves demonstrated the XGBoost model’s high predictive capability. The DCA curve revealed higher benefit rates for patients who underwent interventional treatment under the XGBoost model. The AUC value for the external validation set was 0.74, which indicated that the XGBoost prediction model possessed good extrapolative capacity. Conclusion: The myocardial injury prediction model for patients undergoing CME that was developed using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm in this study demonstrates both high predictive accuracy and clinical utility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153947846"

It is made up of several algorithms that work together to identify patterns in the data. Machine learning provides many benefits over traditional regression techniques, including a lower necessity for a priori predictor information and a higher capacity for managing huge datasets. Recent research has made significant progress toward using machine learning more effectively in spinal cord injury (SCI). Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injuries. Non-traumatic spinal cord injuries often reflect degenerative spine conditions that cause spinal cord compression, such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. This article proposes a novel correlated graph model (CGM) that adopts correlated learning to predict various outcomes published in traumatic and non-traumatic SCI. In the studies mentioned, machine learning is used for several purposes, including imaging analysis and epidemiological data set prediction.

The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports, and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps in the research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145664207"

It is extremely challenging to accurately treat a great deal of casualties with airway obstruction in hospitals. The diagnosis of airway obstruction in an emergency mostly relies on the medical experience of physicians. In this paper, we propose the feature selection approach genetic algorithm-mean decrease impurity (GA-MDI) to effectively minimize the number of features as well as ensure the accuracy of prediction. Furthermore, we design a multi-modal neural network, called fully convolutional network with squeeze-and-excitation and multilayer perceptron (FCN-SE + MLP), to help physicians to predict the severity of airway obstruction. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection approach and multi-modal model on the emergency medical database from the Chinese General Hospital of the PLA. The experimental results show that GA-MDI outperforms the existing feature selection algorithms, while it is also validated that the model FCN-SE + MLP can effectively and accurately achieve the prediction of the severity of airway obstruction, which can assist clinicians in making treatment decisions for airway obstruction casualties.

The primary aim was to cross-validate a previously developed classification algorithm using a different sample, while a secondary aim was to examine its ability to predict future ACL injuries. The examined outcome measure was ‘healthy-limb’ class membership probability, which was compared between a cohort of athletes without previous or future (No Injury) previous (PACL) and future ACL injury (FACL). The No Injury group had significantly higher probabilities than the PACL (p < 0.001; medium effect) and FACL group (p ≤ 0.045; small effect). The ability to predict group membership was poor for the PACL (area under curve [AUC]; 0.61<AUC<0.62) and FACL group (0.57<AUC<0.59). The ACL injury incidence proportion was highest in athletes with probabilities below 0.20 (9.4%; +2.7% to baseline), while athletes with probabilities above 0.80 had an incidence proportion of 4.1% (−2.6%). While findings that a low probability might represent an increase in injury risk on a group level, it is not sensitive enough for injury screening to predict a future injury on the individual level. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111690903"

A recent study described a series of models that outperformed previously published models in predicting acute kidney injury up to 48 h in advance, including a recurrent neural network that achieved state-of-the-art performance (area under the curve 0.92) and a gradient-boosted decision tree model that was close behind (area under the curve 0.89). Because these models were trained in a population of US veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its generalizability to other health systems where the populations are more sex balanced. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how well an acute kidney injury model trained in a population of US veterans performs in females at the Veterans Affairs and the extent to which its performance generalizes to a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting acute kidney injury in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of acute kidney injury and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of acute kidney injury. We demonstrate that, while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of characterizing the generalizability of artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143148282"

To this end, technological advancements have enabled the collection of multiple points of data for use in analysis and injury prediction. The full breadth of available data has, however, only recently begun to be explored using suitable statistical methods. Advances in automatic and interactive data analysis with the help of machine learning are now being used to better establish the intricacies of the player load and injury relationship. In this article, we examine this recent research, describing the analyses and algorithms used, reporting the key findings, and comparing model fit. To date, the vast array of variables used in analysis as proxy indicators of player load, alongside differences in approach to key aspects of data treatment—such as response to data imbalance, model fitting, and a lack of multi-season data—limit a systematic evaluation of findings and the drawing of a unified conclusion. If, however, the limitations of current studies can be addressed, machine learning has much to offer the field and could in future provide solutions to the training load and injury paradox through enhanced and systematic analysis of athlete data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131888217"

With the development of nursing informatization, a large amount of structured and unstructured data has been generated, and it is difficult for traditional methods to utilize these data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence and nursing, it has become a new trend to apply machine learning algorithms to build pressure injury prediction models to manage pressure injuries. However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of the method and which of a large number of algorithms for machine learning is more applicable to pressure injuries. Objective: This review aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms for pressure injury management, to further evaluate and compare pressure injury prediction models constructed by numerous machine learning algorithms, and to derive evidence for the best algorithms for predicting and managing pressure injuries. Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic electronic search was conducted in the EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. We included all retrospective diagnostic accuracy trials and prospective diagnostic accuracy trials constructing a predictive model by machine learning for pressure injuries up to December 2021. Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The network meta-analysis was conducted using statistical software R and STATA. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Result: Twenty-five clinical diagnostic trials with a total of 237397 participants were identified in this review. The results of our study revealed that pressure injury machine learning models can effectively predict these injuries. Combining the algorithms separately yields the main results: decision trees (sensitivity: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.84, specificity: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96, diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]: 18, 95% CI: 7 to 49, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), logistic regression (sensitivity: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80, specificity: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89, DOR: 12, 95% CI: 9 to 17, AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.87), neural networks (sensitivity: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86, specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87, DOR: 9, 95% CI: 5 to 19, AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.85), random forests (sensitivity: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.95, specificity: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99, DOR: 56, 95% CI: 3 to 1258, AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), support vector machines (sensitivity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90, specificity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.93, DOR: 19, 95% CI: 6 to 54, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.90). According to the analysis of ROC and AUC values, random forest is the best algorithm for the prediction model of pressure injury. Conclusions: This review revealed that machine learning algorithms are generally effective in predicting pressure injuries, and after data merging, the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for pressure injury prediction. Further well-designed diagnostic controlled trials are recommended to strengthen the current evidence.

Artificial intelligence techniques such as predictive analysis, automatic highlight generation, and assistant coaching have been applied to improve performance and decision-making for teams and players. To perform any high-level analysis from a game match, collecting the locations (where) and identities (who) of players is crucial and challenging. In this paper, a universal JErsey number DEtector (JEDE) for player identification is presented that predicts players' bounding boxes and keypoints, along with bounding boxes and classes of jersey digits and numbers in an end-to-end manner. Instead of generating digit proposals from pre-defined anchors, JEDE predicts more robust proposals guided by players' features and pose estimation. Moreover, a dataset is collected from soccer and basketball matches with annotations on players' bounding boxes and body keypoints, and jersey digits' bounding boxes and labels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the collected dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Both quantitative and qualitative results also demonstrate JEDE's superior practicality and generalizability over different sports. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133731619"

The risk of acquiring AKI was evaluated by a support vector machine (SVM) model, which is a statistical model commonly used for classification tasks. The inputs of the SVM model were the data collected 1 hour before the race, and the output of the SVM model was the decision of acquiring AKI.

Such applications not only play an important role during matches but also have a great influence on the training stage. However, applying deep learning techniques to sports analytics has several technical challenges, which also remain untouched in badminton analytics as there is no public dataset of stroke event records. Therefore, this dissertation intends to explore challenging research questions and application issues that have not been addressed for benefiting both the research and badminton communities. To achieve the objectives, we, for the first time, propose a unified badminton language to describe the process of the shot, which enables us to conduct downstream applications. Specifically, our first task is to measure the win probability of each shot in badminton matches by considering long-term and short-term dependencies. Second, we introduce a framework with two encoder-decoder extractors and a position-aware fusion network to forecast the possible tactics of players, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. To provide the transparency of these models, we aim to design a post-hoc explainer by computing feature attributions with Shapley values as the third task. In this manner, researchers can investigate model behaviors for advanced improvement, and the badminton community benefits from coaching the players and determining the strategies.

One important task in this context is the performance measurement of individual players to provide reports and log files for subsequent analysis. During sport events like basketball, this involves the re-identification of players during a match either from multiple camera viewpoints or from a single camera viewpoint at different times. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the out-standing zero-shot performance of pre-Trained CLIP models to the domain of player re-identification. For this purpose we reformulate the contrastive language-To-image pre-Training approach from CLIP to a contrastive image-To-image training approach using the InfoNCE loss as training objective. Unlike previous work, our approach is entirely class-Agnostic and benefits from large-scale pre-Training. With a fine-Tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 model we achieve 98.44% mAP on the MMSports 2022 Player Re-Identification challenge. Furthermore we show that the CLIP Vision Transformers have already strong OCR capabilities to identify useful player features like shirt numbers in a zero-shot manner without any fine-Tuning on the dataset. By applying the Score-CAM algorithm we visualise the most important image regions that our fine-Tuned model identifies when calculating the similarity score between two images of a player. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141431894"

Due to the degree to which the camera can be affected by lighting and wearable sensors scantiness, neither one modality can capture the required data to perform the task confidently. That being the case, range sensors, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can complement the process to perceive the environment more robustly. Most recently, researchers have been exploring ways to apply convolutional neural networks to 3-D data. These methods typically rely on a single modality and cannot draw on information from complementing sensor streams to improve accuracy. This article proposes a framework to tackle human activity recognition by leveraging the benefits of sensor fusion and multimodal machine learning. Given both RGB and point cloud data, our method describes the activities being performed by subjects using regions with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and a 3-D modified Fisher vector network. Evaluated on a custom captured multimodal dataset demonstrates that the model outputs remarkably accurate human activity classification (90%). Furthermore, this framework can be used for sports analytics, understanding social behavior, surveillance, and perhaps most notably by autonomous vehicles (AVs) to data-driven decision-making policies in urban areas and indoor environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113198956"

The most important features are used to train five machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), LogitBoost (LB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB). For comparative reasons, the best model is also tested on the English Premier League and the Dutch Eredivisie, exploiting data statistics from six seasons from 2014 to 2020. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning are also tested by encoding tabular data to images, using 10-fold cross-validation, after applying grid and randomized hyperparameter tuning: DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and ResNet101V2. This is the first time the Greek Super League is investigated in depth, providing important features and comparative performance between several machine and deep learning models, as well as between other leagues.

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138006866"

Consequently, elite football clubs have been consistently interested in having practical, interpretable, and usable models as decision-making support for technical staff. This study aimed to analyze predictive modeling of injury risk based on body composition variables and selected physical fitness tests for elite football players through a sports season. The sample comprised 36 male elite football players who competed in the First Portuguese Soccer League in the 2020/2021 season. The models were calculated based on 22 independent variables that included players’ information, body composition, physical fitness, and one dependent variable, the number of injuries per season. In the net elastic analysis, the variables that best predicted injury risk were sectorial positions (defensive and forward), body height, sit-and-reach performance, 1 min number of push-ups, handgrip strength, and 35 m linear speed. This study considered multiple-input single-output regression-type models. The analysis showed that the most accurate model presented in this work generates an error of RMSE = 0.591. Our approach opens a novel perspective for injury prevention and training monitorization.

This article aims instead to propose a causal inference approach to sports analysis. In particular, the present article intends to review the famous four-factor model proposed by Dean Oliver for assessing the winning ability of National Basketball Association (NBA) teams through a causal inference approach. A structural equation model is used to validate Oliver’s model. The present paper considers the winning percentage and the factors’ statistics over entire seasons from 1996-1997 to 2020-2021. The statistics for the 2019-2020 season are considered only on a subset of the games. This is because the games played in the Orlando bubble under the particular COVID-19 situation have been regarded as outliers compared to the games played in the other NBA seasons, hence they have not been taken into account. The second goal of the article is to analyse if the fitting ability of the four-factor model changes when it is fitted over the pre-2021 and post-2010 basketball eras datasets, considering the year 2010 as the turning point for the NBA playing style. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122753260"

Methodology: Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Facebook Prophet (Prophet) models were used for time series prediction of the number of RTIs inpatients. The three models were trained using data from 2015 to 2019, and their prediction accuracy was compared using data from 2020 as a test set. The parameters of the SARIMA model were determined using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). The LSTM uses linear as the activation function, the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function and the Adam optimizer to construct the model, while the Prophet model is built on the Python platform. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to measure the predictive performance of the model. Findings: In this research, the LSTM model had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the Prophet model, and the SARIMA model had the lowest prediction accuracy. The trend in medical expenditure of RTIs inpatients overlapped highly with the number of RTIs inpatients. Conclusion: By adjusting the activation function and optimizer, the LSTM predicts the number of RTIs inpatients more accurately and robustly than other models. Compared with other models, LSTM models still show excellent prediction performance in the face of data with seasonal and drastic changes. The LSTM can provide a better basis for planning and management in healthcare administration. Implication: The results of this research show that it is feasible to accurately forecast the demand for healthcare resources with seasonal distribution using a suitable forecasting model. The prediction of specific medical service volumes will be an important basis for medical management to allocate medical and health resources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135474470"

Secondly, we discover the present status of AI use in elite sports. Therefore, in addition to another literature review, we interviewed leading sports scientist, which are closely connected to the main national service institute for elite sports in their countries. The analysis of this literature review and the interviews show that the most activity is carried out in the methodical categories of signal and image processing.

Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-Time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion.

Advances in machine learning has demonstrated success in AKI risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs). However, to prevent AKI, it is critical to identify clinically modifiable factors and understand their impact at different prevention windows. Method: We extracted 4129 clinical variables including demographics, social history, past diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, vitals from EHRs for a cohort of 144,084 eligible inpatient encounters. We developed a multi-view learning framework for XGBoost (MV-XGB) to enhance algorithm attention on modifiable factors. To study effects of modifiable factors at different time points, we built AKI prediction models at 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours before AKI onset. To characterize the temporal changes in effect of modifiable factors on AKI, we derived two indicators, inter-class score-difference and exposed-score-difference, based on SHAP values to compare effects of modifiable factors in different windows. Result: MV-XGB effectively increased attention on modifiable factors (explained 92.4%-94.1% inter-class score-difference, i.e., predictive difference between AKI and non-AKI samples) while maintaining good predictive performance (AUROCs were 0.854, 0.798, 0.765 in models for 24–48-72 h AKI prediction respectively). We observed that 62% of predicted odds-ratio difference between AKI and non-AKI patients in 24 h can be explained by factors occurring between 24 and 72 h. Among the important modifiable factors, electrolyte balance explained 38.3% of the inter-class score difference increase between 24 h and 72 h, followed by high-risk medications (13.7%), care strategy (12.1%), blood pressure (10%), infection (7.8%), and anemia (5.4%). Effects of cardiac surgery or condition, respiratory ventilation, and anemia remained important longer than 72 h. Conclusion: Better understanding of the clinically modifiable factors is important to AKI prevention. The proposed multi-view learning approach improved the identification of modifiable factors of AKI and allowed characterization of the temporal dynamics of their potential benefit in intervention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129491871"

With cricket being a very dynamic game, bettors and bookies are incentivised to bet on the match results because it is a game that changes ball-by-ball. This paper investigates machine learning technology to deal with the problem of predicting cricket match results based on historical match data of the IPL. Influential features of the dataset have been identified using filter-based methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain (IG), ReliefF and Wrapper. More importantly, machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Model Trees (classification via regression) have been adopted to generate predictive models from distinctive feature sets derived by the filter-based methods. Two featured subsets were formulated, one based on home team advantage and other based on Toss decision. Selected machine learning techniques were applied on both feature sets to determine a predictive model. Experimental tests show that tree-based models particularly Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics when compared to probabilistic and statistical models. However, on the Toss featured subset, none of the considered machine learning algorithms performed well in producing accurate predictive models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075933396"

Broadly, these methods trade large reductions in pre-processing cost for increases in query execution cost: during query execution, they apply query-specific machine learning operations over portions of the video dataset. Although video query optimizers reduce the overall cost of executing a single query over large video datasets compared to naive object tracking methods, executing several queries over the same video remains cost-prohibitive; moreover, the high per-query latency makes these systems unsuitable for exploratory analytics where fast response times are crucial. In this paper, we present OTIF, a video pre-processor that efficiently extracts all object tracks from large-scale video datasets. By integrating several optimizations under a joint parameter tuning framework, OTIF is able to extract all object tracks from video as fast as existing video query optimizers can execute just one single query. In contrast to the outputs of video query optimizers, OTIF's outputs are general-purpose object tracks that can be used to execute many queries with sub-second latencies. We compare OTIF against three recent video query optimizers, as well as several general-purpose object detection and tracking techniques, and find that, across multiple datasets, OTIF provides a 6x to 25x average reduction in the overall cost to execute five queries over the same video. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132450665"

Although corners are repeatable and static situations, due to their low conversion rates, several studies in literature failed to find useable insights about the efficiency of various corner strategies. Our work aims to fill this gap. We hand-label the role of each defensive player from 213 corners in 33 matches, where we then employ an augmentation strategy to increase the number of data points. By combining a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory neural network, we are able to detect the defensive strategy of each player based on positional data. We identify which of seven well-established roles a defensive player conducted (player-marking, zonal-marking, placed for counterattack, back-space, short defender, near-post, and far-post). The model achieves an overall weighted accuracy of 89.3%, and in the case of player-marking, we are able to accurately detect which offensive player the defender is marking 80.8% of the time. The performance of the model is evaluated against a rule-based baseline model, as well as by an inter-labeller accuracy. We demonstrate that rules can also be used to support the labelling process and serve as a baseline for weak supervision approaches. We show three concrete use-cases on how this approach can support a more informed and fact-based decision making process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140370599"

It directly leads to the high wear attrition of the drug. At present, there are a variety of computer algorithms based on molecular representations to predict DILI. It is found that a single molecular representation method is insufficient to complete the task of toxicity prediction, and multiple molecular fingerprint fusion methods have been used as model input. In order to solve the problem of high dimensional and unbalanced DILI prediction data, this paper integrates existing datasets and designs a new algorithm framework, Rotation-Ensemble-GA (R-E-GA). The main idea is to find a feature subset with better predictive performance after rotating the fusion vector of high-dimensional molecular representation in the feature space. Then, an Adaboost-type ensemble learning method is integrated into R-E-GA to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the performance of R-E-GA is better than other state-of-art algorithms including ensemble learning-based and graph neural network-based methods. Through five-fold cross-validation, the R-E-GA obtains an ACC of 0.77, an F1 score of 0.769, and an AUC of 0.842.

In this paper, we present a machine learning model trained to predict the occurrence of a lower-limb overuse injury (LLOI).

Machine Learning and Data Mining advances have enabled sports analysts to evaluate a player's performance more effectively. A review of existing literature on player performance evaluation methods shows the need to develop a new performance evaluation index for Twenty20 (T20) Cricket. We propose a Deep Player Performance Index (DPPI) to evaluate a T20 Cricket player based on batting and bowling strengths. DPPI captures a player's current form and role in the team. DPPI serves a dual purpose. First, it enables sports fans and researchers to compare players playing a similar role in different teams. Second, the aggregated DPPI values of players playing at different positions in a team give the approximate team strength. To build DPPI, we first modify the existing Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) player performance evaluation guidelines. We then use the modified guidelines in the context of T20 Cricket. We propose DPPI based on K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithm and compare our results with the existing player performance evaluation indexes for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019 season. Our empirical results show that DPPI captures a player's batting and bowling strength better than other indexes. Thus, DPPI serves as a helpful index for fantasy Cricket users, Cricket fans, coaches, and managers to gain better insights into a player's performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135692480"

Thus, there has been a great demand for in silico DILI prediction models for successful drug discovery. To date, various models have been developed for DILI pre-diction; however, building an accurate model for practical use in drug discovery remains challenging. Methods: We constructed an ensemble model composed of three high-performance DILI prediction models to utilize the unique advantage of each machine learning algorithm. Results: The ensemble model exhibited high predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.88, sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.77, F1-score of 0.82, and accuracy of 0.80. When a test dataset collected from the literature was used to compare the performance of our model with publicly available DILI prediction models, our model achieved an accuracy of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.72, and F1-score of 0.79, which were higher than those of the other DILI prediction models. As many pub-lished DILI prediction models are not available for public access, which hinders in silico drug discov-ery, we made our DILI prediction model publicly accessible (http://ssbio.cau.ac.kr/software/dili/). Conclusion: We expect that our ensemble model may facilitate advancements in drug discovery by providing a highly predictive model and reducing the drug withdrawal rate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133381972"

Methods: We used a machine learning technique like boosted ensembles of decision trees along with novel kidney biomarkers to predict AKI using retrospective data extracted from the MIMIC-III dataset. Results: Our proposed algorithm achieved high AUROC for diagnosing and predicting AKI with novel kidney biomarkers. For AKI prediction at the point of onset, the algorithm achieved an AUROC of 0.890 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.878). Also, our proposed algorithm obtained an AUROC of 0.82 (95 percent CI, 0.792-0.809) for predictions made 12-hours before onset and an AUROC of 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.785-0.804) for 24-hours predictions.

In this study, sEMG signals are collected from the skin surface and features are extracted to be used in deep learning networks. A wearable hardware collects sEMG signals and transfers them to our mobile application via Bluetooth. The mobile application transfers data to the cloud to make predictions based on sEMG signals.

The data used in the study are derived from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III, which is a freely accessible database of de-identified ICU-related data. The paper focuses on two different phases. The first one consists of a scrupulous phase of extraction and transformation of MIMIC data to retrieve all the criteria specified in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline definition of AKI. The main features included are demographics, medications, comorbidities, charted vital signs, and laboratory events. In the second phase, we used several different techniques already used to predict AKI, and we also added a complex temporal feature, called Trend-Event Feature (TE-F). The prediction was performed using a rolling observational window design that includes the data collection window (length: 1 to 6 days) and the prediction window (7 days). The Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) method was used, with different groups of features, to predict the risk of AKI. To evaluate the GBDT performances, we used the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), Recall, Precision, and F-score measures. We observed that lab parameters contribute the most to the prediction of the AKI risk. Moreover, adding TE-Fs to different groups of features leads to better performance results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139057768"

Obtaining player identities is essential for analyzing the game and is used in downstream tasks such as game event recognition. Transformers are the existing standard in natural language processing (NLP) and are swiftly gaining traction in computer vision. Motivated by the increasing success of transformers in computer vision, we introduce a transformer network for recognizing players through their jersey numbers in broadcast National Hockey League (NHL) videos. The transformer takes temporal sequences of player frames (called player tracklets) as input and outputs the probabilities of jersey numbers present in the frames. The proposed network performs better than the previous benchmark on the same dataset. We implement a weakly-supervised training approach by generating approximate frame-level labels for jersey number presence and use the frame-level labels for faster training. We also utilize player shifts available in the NHL play-by-play data by reading the game time using optical character recognition (OCR) to get the players on the ice rink at a certain game time.

An effective team is made up of a successful group of individual talented players. In general, a football team player selection is a decision made by the club based on the best available information. Club managers and scouts travel to different countries to watch matches and hire the best talent that can help their club to perform better. But for the lower leagues, it becomes difficult to hire the same talents because of strict budget. Here we devise a method so that we can leverage the undervalued players to get selected by the clubs. Clearly the benefit will be in two fold. First, the smaller clubs can get better players at an affordable cost. Second, the bigger clubs can get same performance players at a lower price helping them in cost cutting. We employ novelty detection methods to find out the undervalued players from our data and investigate our method by using five machine learning models. For performance evaluation, the five machine learning models used are support vector machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression and XGBoost.

With this problem at hand, we propose a novel methodology for learning temporal point processes based on one-dimensional numerical integration techniques. These techniques are used for linearising the negative maximum likelihood (neML) function and enabling backpropagation of the neML derivatives. Our approach is tested on two real-life datasets. Firstly, on high frequency point process data, (prediction of highway traffic) and secondly, on a very low frequency point processes dataset, (prediction of ski injuries in ski resorts). Four different point process baseline models were compared: second-order Polynomial inhomogeneous process, Hawkes process with exponential kernel, Gaussian process, and Poisson process. The results show the ability of the proposed methodology to generalize on different datasets and illustrate how different numerical integration techniques and mathematical models influence the quality of the obtained models. The presented methodology is not limited to these datasets and can be further used to optimize and predict other processes that are based on temporal point processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135635747"

Because such data is extremely rich and complicated, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Unfortunately, how to evaluate the use of machine learning in the context of sports remains extremely challenging. On the one hand, it is necessary to evaluate the developed indicators themselves, where one is confronted by a lack of labels and small sample sizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate the models themselves, which is complicated by the noisy and non-stationary nature of sports data. In this paper, we highlight the inherent evaluation challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for evaluating both indicators and models.

In this study, an analysis was made on the risk of physical injuries to college students to guarantee the physical safety of students in sports and improve the quality of physical education. Then, a study was carried out on the occurrences of physical injury risks through visual sensing techniques, and an investigation was conducted into the characteristics of physical injury risks in colleges. Next, the student's body shape and physical characteristics are computed using visual sensing techniques, and the risk of sports injuries is evaluated. The results show that the proposed image recognition and computation methods can accurately identify the sports injuries of college students. Furthermore, it can effectively analyze the factors affecting the risk of sports injuries, and the error of the proposed technique remains between -3 and 2. In addition, it can accurately locate the occurrence of sports injury risks and reduce the impact of those risks in time. This work provides technical support for the reduction of sports injury risks and contributes to the improvement of physical education teaching quality in colleges. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129530595"

In recent years, AKI and big data synergies have been explored, particularly through electronic health records (EHR), ideal for AKI risk prediction. Due to the massive amount of data in EHR, machine learning (ML) models for data analytics are slowly rising.

The data was collected during a pandemic-condensed season with unpredictable interruptions to the games and athletic training schedules. We collected data from sleep monitoring devices, training data from coaches, injury reports from medical staff, and weekly survey data from athletes for 22 weeks. With proper data imputation, interpretable feature set, data balancing, and classifiers, we showed that we could predict game performance and injuries with more than 90% accuracy.

Our data analysis also showed that collegiate athletes sleep less than the recommended hours (6-7 instead of 8 hours). This coupled with a long hiatus in games and training increases the risk of injury.

Biomechanical analyses of throwing athletes have identified pathomechanic factors that predispose throwers to injury or poor performance. These factors, or key performance indicators, are an ongoing topic of research, with the goals of improved injury prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation. Important key performance indicators in the literature to date include shoulder and elbow torque, shoulder rotation, kinetic chain function (as measured by trunk rotation timing and hip-shoulder separation), and lower-extremity mechanics (including stride characteristics). The current gold standard for biomechanical analysis of the throwing athlete involves marker-based 3-dimensional) video motion capture. Emerging technologies such as marker-less motion capture, wearable technology, and machine learning have the potential to further refine our understanding. This review will discuss the biomechanics of throwing, with particular attention to baseball pitching, while also delineating methods of modern throwing analysis, implications for clinical orthopaedic practice, and future areas of research interest.

With the increase in availability of so-called positional data, describing the positioning of players and ball at every moment of the game, our work aims to determine the difficulty of every pass by calculating its success probability based on its surrounding circumstances. As most experts will agree, not all passes are of equal difficulty, however, most traditional metrics count them as such. With our work we can quantify how well players can execute passes, assess their risk profile, and even compute completion probabilities for hypothetical passes by combining physical and machine learning models. Our model uses the first 0.4 seconds of a ball trajectory and the movement vectors of all players to predict the intended target of a pass with an accuracy of 93.0 % for successful and 72.0 % for unsuccessful passes much higher than any previously published work. Our extreme gradient boosting model can then quantify the likelihood of a successful pass completion towards the identified target with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.4 %.

However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level (what the constituents are) and clip-level (how those constituents are organized). We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118620803"

Early prediction of DILI can bring a significant reduction in the cost of clinical trials. In this work we examined whether occurrence of DILI can be predicted using gene expression profile in cancer cell lines and chemical properties of drugs. Methods: We used gene expression profiles from 13 human cell lines, as well as molecular properties of drugs to build Machine Learning models of DILI. To this end, we have used a robust cross-validated protocol based on feature selection and Random Forest algorithm. In this protocol we first identify the most informative variables and then use them to build predictive models. The models are first built using data from single cell lines, and chemical properties. Then they are integrated using Super Learner method with several underlying methods for integration. The entire modelling process is performed using nested cross-validation. Results: We have obtained weakly predictive ML models when using either molecular descriptors, or some individual cell lines (AUC ∈(0.55−0.61)).

This is a very challenging task especially in the case of team sports, among which football is a prominent example. This paper is concerned with uncovering a dangerous bias that is present in most of the approaches proposed in the literature that apply statistical techniques or machine learning models to study the correlation between team performances and match outcome. In particular, we find out that players’ behavior on a time interval is more and more correlated with the match outcome as the 90 minutes elapse. As an extreme example, we show that we can predict the output of a match with high confidence simply by looking at the last 15 minutes of the game. We call this effect elapsing-time bias. We conduct a quantitative analysis that proves the existence of this phenomenon and shows its consequences. We then propose a novel way to address the problem. Namely, we design a new machine learning task that is not affected by elapsing-time bias.

Although injuries are difficult to forecast, novel technologies and data-science applications could provide important insights. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs. Methods: Prediction of injuries was evaluated on a new data set of 74 high-level middle- and long-distance runners, over a period of 7 years. Two analytic approaches were applied. First, the training load from the previous 7 days was expressed as a time series, with each day’s training being described by 10 features. These features were a combination of objective data from a global positioning system watch (eg, duration, distance), together with subjective data about the exertion and success of the training. Second, a training week was summarized by 22 aggregate features, and a time window of 3 weeks before the injury was considered. Results: A predictive system based on bagged XGBoost machine-learning models resulted in receiver operating characteristic curves with average areas under the curves of 0.724 and 0.678 for the day and week approaches, respectively. The results of the day approach especially reflect a reasonably high probability that our system makes correct injury predictions. Conclusions: Our machine-learning-based approach predicts a sizable portion of the injuries, in particular when the model is based on training-load data in the days preceding an injury. Overall, these results demonstrate the possible merits of using machine learning to predict injuries and tailor training programs for athletes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116237499"

In this contribution, we consider a comprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising 289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hidden Markov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFL season is 71.6%, which is similar compared to existing studies on play call predictions in the NFL. In practice, such predictions are helpful for NFL teams, especially for defense coordinators, to make adjustments in real time on the field. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115966933"

Investments in electricity will continue to increase, leading to construction project complexities, which undoubtedly contribute to injuries and associated effects. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to quantify and model causes of injuries; however, conventional ML techniques do not produce optimal results since they require careful engineering to transform data into suitable forms. In this study, we develop and compare state-of-the-art ML algorithms (deep learning and boosted trees) with other conventional methods to overcome this problem by analyzing incident cases obtained from a leading UK power infrastructure company. The predictive performance of the developed models was benchmarked using a statistical comparison between observations and predicted values. Results showed that the implementation of deep feedforward neural networks achieved the best predictions (accuracy = 0.967 and Cohen Kappa measure = 0.964). Furthermore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of input parameters and data sizes on the modes’ behavior. The sensitivity analysis results showed strong generalization abilities of the deep learning and boosted tree models and their effectiveness for safety risks management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109156431"

A robust binary decision (Yes/No) about the requirement of any irreversible safety action such as the deployment of airbags in the pre-crash phase is a big step. In this work, we investigate different machine learning approaches for determining the severity of occupant injury in two classes: Safe Zone and Injury Zone. One of the essential outcomes of this paper is the selection of the input features through feature engineering. Five machine learning models are investigated and compared based on different evaluation criteria to find the best classification model for the application. XGBoost, Catboost, Random Forest, Kernel SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were trained on data collected through FEM simulations. XGBoost was found to be the best performing model. If the predicted severity lies in the Injury Zone during pre-crash, airbag activation is required. Hence, this prediction can be used in pre-crash for steering an inevitable crash in a crash with low severity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118466274"

The analysis was conducted on data collected from the Intensive care units (ICU) at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN and the Cerner® Health Facts Deidentified Database, a multisite COVID-19 EMR database. The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75-0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085-0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81-0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO2), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O2 flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18-40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92-0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81-0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups. The eARDS system demonstrated robust performance for predicting COVID19 patients who developed ARDS at least 12-hours before the Berlin clinical criteria, across two independent health systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115803324"

The purpose of this paper is not only to automatically identify this strategy, but also to derive metrics that support coaches with the analysis of transition situations. Additionally, we want to infer objective influence factors for its success and assess the validity of peer-created rules of thumb established in by practitioners. Based on a combination of positional and event data we detect counterpressing situations as a supervised machine learning task. Together, with professional match-analysis experts we discussed and consolidated a consistent definition, extracted 134 features and manually labeled more than 20, 000 defensive transition situations from 97 professional football matches. The extreme gradient boosting model—with an area under the curve of 87.4 % on the labeled test data—enabled us to judge how quickly teams can win the ball back with counterpressing strategies, how many shots they create or allow immediately afterwards and to determine what the most important success drivers are. We applied this automatic detection on all matches from six full seasons of the German Bundesliga and quantified the defensive and offensive consequences when applying counterpressing for each team. Automating the task saves analysts a tremendous amount of time, standardizes the otherwise subjective task, and allows to identify trends within larger data-sets. We present an effective way of how the detection and the lessons learned from this investigation are integrated effectively into common match-analysis processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109670297"

Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players.

In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies…. and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology: This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis: MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation. Complexity academic level: The case is written and designed for a graduate-level (MBA) class or an upper-level undergraduate class in areas such as contemporary issues in management, human resource management, talent management, strategic management, sports management and sports marketing. The case is suitable for courses that discuss strategy, talent management, human resource management and brand strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117343676"

One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115393426"

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24Â° and a 90%-ile error of 18.33Â° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108018142"

A diverse dataset containing video data of 11 basic strokes obtained from 14 professional table tennis players, summing up to a total of 22111 videos has been collected using the proposed setup. The temporal convolutional neural network model developed using 2D pose estimation performs multiclass classification of these 11 table tennis strokes with a validation accuracy of 99.37%. Moreover, the neural network generalizes well over the data of a player excluded from the training and validation dataset, classifying the fresh strokes with an overall best accuracy of 98.72%. Various model architectures using machine learning and deep learning based approaches have been trained for stroke recognition and their performances have been compared and benchmarked. Inferences such as performance monitoring and stroke comparison of the players using the model have been discussed. Therefore, we are contributing to the development of a computer vision based sports analytics system for the sport of table tennis that focuses on the previously unexploited aspect of the sport i.e., a player's strokes, which is extremely insightful for performance improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116066971"

The large number of indicators in AKI patients makes it difficult for clinicians to quickly and accurately determine the patient's condition. This study used machine learning methods to filter key indicators and use key indicator data to achieve advance prediction of AKI so that a small number of indicators could be measured to reliably predict AKI and provide auxiliary decision support for clinical staff. Sequential forward selection based on feature importance calculated by XGBoost was used to screen out 17 key indicators. Three machine learning algorithms were used to make predictions, namely, logistic regression (LR), decision tree, and XGBoost. To verify the validity of the method, data were extracted from the MIMIC III database and the eICU-CRD database for 1,009 and 1,327 AKI patients, respectively. The MIMIC III database was used for internal validation, and the eICU-CRD database was used for external validation. For all three machine learning algorithms, the prediction performance from using only the key indicator dataset was very close to that from using the full dataset. The XGBoost algorithm performed the best, and LR was the next best. The decision tree performed the worst. The key indicator screening method proposed in this study can achieve a good predictive performance while streamlining the number of indicators. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111306403"

The main challenge in such recognition tasks is to learn the relationship between a group of individuals in a scene and its evolution over time. Recently, many techniques based on deep networks and graphical models have been proposed for group activity recognition. In this paper, we critically analyze the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for group activity recognition.

Towards addressing this problem, this paper presents ZeroNet, a system that shows the feasibility of developing ML models for IMU sensors with zero training overhead. ZeroNet harvests training data from publicly available videos for performing inferences on IMU. The difference in data among video and IMU domains introduces a number of challenges due to differences in sensor-camera coordinate systems, body sizes of users, speed/orientation changes during gesturing, sensor position variations etc. ZeroNet addresses these challenges by systematically extracting motion data from videos and transforming them into acceleration and orientation information measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, data-augmentation techniques are exploited that create synthetic variations in the harvested training data to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the ML models to user diversity. Evaluation with 10 users demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 82.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 94.8% for recognition of 50 finger gestures thus indicating promise.

Although early prediction of AKI has the potential to reduce adverse patient outcomes, it remains a difficult condition to predict and diagnose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict for AKI as defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 or 3 up to 48 hours in advance of onset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and patient electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: A CNN prediction system was developed to use EHR data gathered during patients’ stays to predict AKI up to 48 hours before onset. A total of 12,347 patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. An XGBoost AKI prediction model and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system were used as comparators. The outcome was AKI onset. The model was trained on routinely collected patient EHR data. Measurements included area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, positive predictive value (PPV), and a battery of additional performance metrics for advance prediction of AKI onset. Results: On a hold-out test set, the algorithm attained an AUROC of 0.86 and PPV of 0.24, relative to a cohort AKI prevalence of 7.62%, for long-horizon AKI prediction at a 48-hour window before onset. Conclusion: A CNN machine learning-based AKI prediction model outperforms XGBoost and the SOFA scoring system, revealing superior performance in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset, without reliance on serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103568344"

J Strength Cond Res 35(4): 910-919, 2021-This study used machine learning (ML) to predict injuries among adolescents by functional movement testing. This research is a part of the CRO-PALS study conducted in a representative sample of adolescents and analyses for this study are based on nonathletic (n = 364) and athletic (n = 192) subgroups of the cohort (16-17 years). Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), body fatness, moderate-To-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), training hours per week, Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and socioeconomic status were assessed at baseline. A year later, data on injury occurrence were collected. The optimal cut-point of the total FMS score for predicting injury was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve. These predictors were included in ML analyses with calculated metrics: Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with associated criterium of total FMS score >12 showed AUC of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.48-0.59) and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.47-0.63), for the nonathletic and athletic youth, respectively. However, in the nonathletic subgroup, ML showed that the Naïve Bayes exhibited highest AUC (0.58), whereas in the athletic group, logistic regression was demonstrated as the model with the best predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.62). In both subgroups, with given predictors: sex, age, BMI, body fat percentage, MVPA, training hours per week, socioeconomic status, and total FMS score, ML can give a more accurate prediction then FMS alone. Results indicate that nonathletic boys who have lower-body fat could be more prone to suffer from injury incidence, whereas among athletic subjects, boys who spend more time training are at a higher risk of being injured. Conclusively, total FMS cut-off scores for each subgroup did not successfully discriminate those who suffered from those who did not suffer from injury, and, therefore, our research does not support FMS as an injury prediction tool. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103473355"

Poor predictive ability of urine output (UOP) and creatinine contribute to the delayed recognition of AKI. Objective.—To determine the impact of point-of-care (POC) AKI biomarker enhanced by machine learning (ML) algorithms in burn-injured and trauma patients. Design.—We conducted a 2-phased study to develop and validate a novel POC device for measuring neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine from blood samples. In phase I, 40 remnant plasma samples were used to evaluate the analytic performance of the POC device. Next, phase II enrolled 125 adults with either burns that were 20% or greater of total body surface area or nonburn trauma with suspicion of AKI for clinical validation. We applied an automated ML approach to develop models predicting AKI, using a combination of NGAL, creatinine, and/or UOP as features. Results.—Point-of-care NGAL (mean [SD] bias: 9.8 [38.5] ng/mL, P ¼ .10) and creatinine results (mean [SD] bias: 0.28 [0.30] mg/dL, P ¼ .18) were comparable to the reference method. NGAL was an independent predictor of AKI (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.08–5.20; P ¼ .01). The optimal ML model achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96%, 92.3%, and 97.7%, respectively, with NGAL, creatinine, and UOP as features. Area under the receiver operator curve was 0.96. Conclusions.—Point-of-care NGAL testing is feasible and produces results comparable to reference methods.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used the design science research paradigm and the cognitive analytics management (CAM) theory to develop the research framework. A dataset on MLB's free agents between 2013 and 2017 was collected. A decision support tool was built using artificial neural networks. Findings: There are clear links between a player's statistical performance and the decision of the player to sign a new offered contract. “Age,” “Wins above Replacement” and “the team on which a player last played” are the most significant factors in determining if a player signs a new contract.

It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102153307"

Each player was characterized according to a set of 52 non-spatiotemporal descriptors including offensive, defensive and build-up variables that were computed from OPTA’s on-ball event records of the matches for 18 national leagues between the 2012 and 2019 seasons. To test whether positions could be identified from the statistical performance of the players, the dimensionality reduction techniques were used. To better understand the differences between the player positions, the most discriminatory variables for each group were obtained as a set of rules discovered by RIPPER, a machine learning algorithm. From the combination of both techniques, we obtained useful conclusions to enhance the performance of players and to identify positions on the field. The study demonstrates the suitability and potential of artificial intelligence to characterize players' positions according to their technical-tactical behaviour, providing valuable information to the professionals of this sport. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091724570"

Recent advances in data collection and data science have opened up new possibilities for performing a data-driven analysis to support the coach in improving the training programs of the athletes. In this paper, we investigate several methods to do such analysis for professional cyclists. We provide the coach with a framework to predict the Maximum Mean Powers (MMPs) of a cyclist in an upcoming race based on the recently performed training sessions. This way the coach can experiment with several planned alternatives to figure out the best way for preparing the athlete for a race. We conduct multiple prediction models through an extensive analysis of a real dataset collected recently about the performance of professional riders with varying physiologies and temporal performance peaks. We show that the application of the hybrid model using XGBoost and CatBoost has clear advantages. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of our general model can be further increased by filtering according to the mountain stages. We have additionally validated the proposed framework using an openly available real dataset and the results were consistent with those of the collected data.

No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. In the past, traditional machine learning methods such as logistic regression and XGBoost mainly used laboratory data and the statistical features of vital signs data to predict the occurrence of AKI. These methods have achieved good predictive performance, but the statistical values obviously cannot represent all the information of vital signs data. Therefore, a TCN-based model is proposed in this paper. The patient's vital signs data in the ICU, laboratory examination data, and statistical features of monitoring data are fused as input to the model. Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced into our model to discover more useful temporal features by calculating the independence between statistics and monitoring data. In addition, we also explore the impact of changes in vital signs on the occurrence of AKI based on complete vital signs data. Numerical experiments were carried out on the public data set MIMIC-III. Compared with the four baseline models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Long-Short Term Memory Network, and XGBoost), our model showed excellent performance. In the ablation experiment, the effectiveness of HSIC in mining temporal features is proven. Moreover, the proposed model can effectively discover important changes in monitoring data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125202949"

The most significant challenges in machine learning include class imbalance and high dimensionality problems. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and observed that both the issues have been studied independently. We found that feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of relevant features, while data sampling seeks to make the data more balanced by adding or removing instances. We also found out that efforts have been taken for studying the effect of the joint use of feature selection and balancing techniques. However, the prioritization of the feature selection and sampling is still difficult, and the relationship between them remains unclear. This paper presents a large-scale comparison of characterizing football players into nine positions by using FIFA video game data, whereas most of the previous studies in this field have focused on characterizing players into only three classes according to their positions. The proposed methodology for the study consists of three main steps. In the first step, the sampling technique is applied to deal with class imbalance, while the second step encompasses the feature selection technique, which deals with the high dimensionality problem. The third step combines feature selection and data sampling to deal with both the issues. We made the comparisons based on nine feature selection algorithms and three balancing techniques, and then we evaluated their performance using the random forest classifier. We found that 1) feature selection techniques did not improve the accuracy of the baseline model, 2) balancing techniques improved the accuracy compared to the baseline, and 3) the results showed superiority of the proposed methodology, involving the joint application of resampling and feature selection with data balanced by the random oversampling (ROS) method and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), compared to the results obtained only through the use of a single technique and from the original imbalanced training set. Overall, the proposed methodology improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the methodology provided a significant decrease in the number of features, from 29 to 10 features on average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118603993"

Based on the country's strong support for traditional national sports, the dragon boat has developed into a traditional national sport with specific influence and popularity among the masses. Eggshell membrane (ESM) has the effect of relieving arthritis, joint pain, and joint stiffness. The supplementary ESM's preventive effect on sports injuries has attracted people's attention. Based on this, this article builds a sports injury prediction model under artificial intelligence and big data monitoring to accurately predict the injuries suffered by athletes, provide help to reduce athletes' injuries during training, and promote the development of dragon boat sports. This article selects 20 members of a dragon boat team from a university and randomly divides them into a control group (supplement of equal amounts of whey protein), a normal group, an ESM low-dose group (26 mg/kg bw/d), and an ESM high-dose group (52 mg/kg bw/d), with 5 people in each group. The subjects were subjected to downhill exercise and immune stimulation experiments. Among them, the subjects in the control group performed downhill exercise for 12 hours, and they were tested for lactic acid (LAC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, malondialdehyde (MDA), hemoglobin (Hb), blood creatinine (CRE), and other related physical and chemical indicators. The other three groups of subjects did not take low-dose and high-dose ESM for 7 consecutive days and were injected with lipopolysaccharide on the 8th day for immune stimulation and tested for interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10), and other related cytokines. The results show that oral egg membrane protein (ESM) can reduce subjects' serum LAC, LDH, urea, MDA, Hb, and CRE concentration. In addition, the ESM can reduce the expression of proinflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α, while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, which provides clinical data for the clinical use of ESM as a supplement for sports injury or for relieving arthritis symptoms. The study shows that egg membrane protein has a protective effect against sports injury and may be regulated by inflammatory factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118565124"

Currently, there is no hybrid model predicting AKI that takes advantage of two types of data. In this research, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for AKI prediction was created using de-identified numeric patient data and ultrasound kidney images. Using data features including serum creatinine among others, two numeric models using MIMIC-III and paired hospital data were developed, and with the hospital ultrasounds, an image-only model was developed. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used, including VGG and Resnet, and they were made into a hybrid model by concatenating feature maps of both types of models to create a new input. The hybrid model successfully predicted AKI and the highest AUROC of the model was 0.953, the first time an AKI machine learning model surpassed an AUROC of 0.9. The model also achieved an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of 0.91. This model can be implemented into urgent clinical settings such as the ICU and aid doctors by assessing the risk of AKI shortly after the patient’s admission to the ICU.

Due to changes in athlete training methods, it has been decided that athletes must bear a great risk of sports injuries. Accurate prediction of injuries is very important for the development of youth soccer. Based on this, this paper proposes a text classification algorithm based on machine learning and builds a sports injury prediction model that can accurately predict athlete injuries, reduce athlete injuries during training, and be effective. We put forward various sports suitable for young athletes, and put forward some measures to prevent and alleviate athletes' injuries. This article selects 48 football players from a college of physical education of a university for testing. The athletes participating in the experiment use professional equipment to collect exercise volume and exercise load data, and real-time records of each athlete's physical fitness data within half a year, through the athlete's exercise volume, exercise load, body metabolism, and physical indicators to predict their sports injury. Experiments show that from the degree of injury, it can be seen that the severe injury is the least, with 5 cases of muscle injury, 2 cases of fascia ligament injury, and 1 case of joint injury. There were 25 cases of mild injuries, accounting for 41.0% of the total. This is because the athlete's sports injury prediction model has better prediction capabilities, allowing athlete coaches and therapists to optimize training courses, ultimately preventing injuries, improving training levels, and reducing rehabilitation costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108458458"

The distributions of, and dose–response between, wellness and other load measures were also examined, offering insights into response patterns. Data (n= 14,109) were collated from an athlete management systems platform (Catapult Sports, Melbourne, Australia) and were split across three sports (cricket, rugby league and football) with data analysis conducted in R (Version 3.4.3). Wellness (sleep quality, readiness to train, general muscular soreness, fatigue, stress, mood, recovery rating and motivation) as the dependent variable, and sRPE, sRPE-TL and markers of external load (total distance and m.min−1) as independent variables were included for analysis. Classification and regression tree models showed high cross-validated error rates across all sports (i.e., > 0.89) and low model accuracy (i.e., < 5% of variance explained by each model) with similar results demonstrated using random forest models. These results suggest wellness items have limited predictive capacity in relation to internal and external load measures. This result was consistent despite varying statistical approaches (regression, classification and random forest models) and transformation of wellness scores. These findings indicate practitioners should exercise caution when interpreting and applying wellness responses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099206448"

The commercialization of sport has encouraged players, coaches, and other concerns to use technology to be in better position than r their opponents. In the past, the focus was on improved training techniques for better physical performance. These days, sports analytics identify the patterns in the performance and highlight strengths and weaknesses of potential players. Sports analytics not only predict the performance of players in the near future but it also performs predictive modeling for a particular behavior of a player in the past. The impact of a smart player on the success of a team is always a big question mark before the start of a match. The fans always want to know performance analysis of these superstar players and they always are interested to get to know more about their favorite player and they always have high hopes from their favorite player. Machine learning (ML) based techniques help in predicting the performance of an individual player as well as for the whole team. The statistics are very vital and useful for management, fans, and expert analysis. In our proposed framework, the adaptive back propagation neural network (ABPNN) model is used for the prediction of a player's performance. The data is collected from football websites, and the results are stored in the cloud for fast fetching of data. They can be retrieved anywhere in the world through cloud storage. The results are computed with 94% accuracy and the performance of the smart player is formulated for the success of a team. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096501181"

The main objective of this study is to accurately predict cardiovascular disease by comparison among different feature selection algorithms. This study has employed a two-stage feature sub-set retrieving technique to achieve this goal: we first considered three well-established feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded), and then, a feature sub-set was extracted using a Boolean process-based common “True” condition from these three algorithms. To justify the comparative accuracy and define the best predictive analytics, the well-known random forest, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost model have been considered. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been considered as the benchmark for further comparison with all features. The experimental outcomes exhibit that the XGBoost Classifier integrated with the wrapper methods offers precise prediction results for cardiovascular disease. The proposed approach can also be applied in other domains such as sports analytics, bio-informatics, and financial analysis in contrast with healthcare informatics.

In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills.

Multimodal analysis can help find the most effective paddling techniques for training and competition based on individuals' abilities. We describe the characteristics of the output power of kayak athletes and Electromyogram (EMG) measurements collected from the most critical muscles, and the relationship between these modalities. We propose metrics (weighted arithmetic mean difference and variability of power output and stroke duration) suitable for discerning athletes based on how efficiently and correctly they perform particular training tasks. Additionally, the described methods (asymmetry, coactivation, muscle intensity-output power) help athletes and coaches in assessing their performance and compare it with others based on their EMG activities.

Recently the development of methods based on machine learning algorithms has provided researchers with more powerful tools to more accurate prediction in different domains and evaluate the factors affecting different phenomena more reliably than traditional regression models. This study tries to investigate the performance of random forest (RF) in identifying factors associated with sports-related dental injuries. Also, the accuracy of the RF model for predicting sports-related dental injuries was compared with logistic regression model as traditional competitor. Methods: This cross-sectional study was applied to 356 athlete children aged 6 to 13-year-old in Hamadan, Iran. Random forest and logistic regression constructed by using sports-related dental injuries as response variables and age, sex, parent’s education, child’s birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, mouthguard use as input. A self-reported questionnaire was used to obtain information. Results: Fifty-five (15.4%) subjects had experienced a sports-related dental injury. The mean age of children with sports injuries was significantly higher than children without the experience of injury (p = 0.006). The prevalence of injury was significantly higher in boys (p = 0.008). Children with illiterate mothers are more likely to be injured than children with educated mothers (p = 0.045). Awareness of mouthguard and its use during exercise has a significant effect on reducing the prevalence of injury among users (p < 0.001). Random forest model has a higher prediction accuracy (89.3%) for predicting sports-related dental injuries compared to the logistic regression (84.2%). The results of the relative importance of variables, based on RF showed, mouthguard use, and mouthguard awareness has more contributed importance in dental sport-related injuries’ prediction. Subsequently, the importance of sex and age is in the next position. Conclusions: Using predictive models such as RF challenges existing inaccurate predictions due to high complexity and interactions between variables would be minimized. This helps to achieve more accurate identification of factors in sport-related dental injury among the general population of children. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095803660"

The major goal in sport analytics applications is to make informed decisions to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse and predict lineup performance in basketball which may assist the team managers and coaches to make informed decisions. The constant lineup change in basketball games makes it vital to always have the best move ready at every moment of the game. A complex decision-making system is very important for the coaches to navigate their team through a season. This system must make the decisions based on the pros and cons of the teams, past results and lineups, and both teams’ performance under similar situations. To create this system, authors have constructed a signed, directed, and weighted network from the results of all matchups and lineups of the teams in NBA from 2007 to 2019. The proposed approach uses machine learning and graph theory to develop a new metric called Inverse Square Metric and edge-centric multi-view networks to predict the performance of a lineup in a given situation. The edge-centric approach provides a deep analysis of any condition between two teams from 16 different perspectives. The average accuracy achieved by ISM and edge-centric multi-view is 68% and 80%, respectively. In the end, the training and test datasets are chosen from different seasons and results are reasonable compared to the baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089844314"

Traditionally, they are treated separately and studied by two independent communities. However, this is not the intuitive way how humans interpret the matches: we predict the match results with the competition carrying on, and simultaneously evaluate each action based on the game context and its downstream impact. Predicting the match outcomes and evaluating the actions are coupled tasks, and the more accurately we predict, the better the evaluation is To this end, we develop a unified Match Tracing framework (namely, MT), for tackling the win prediction and performance evaluation jointly. The main idea of MT is to learn a real-time look-ahead win rate curve rather than a single scalar (win or lose). And the value of an action can be objectively measured with respect to the increase or decrease of the curve. To meet the low-latency restrictions of the online deployments, an efficient model equipped with recurrent attention mechanism and matrix perturbation (i.e., MT-Net) is built for learning and yielding the win rate curve. MT-Net encodes the players' behavior sequence through an attention mechanism and captures the player-interaction effects through a graph embedding method. With the action values derived from the win rate curve, performance can be quantified at different granularities (action/player/match level) by integrated analysis.

Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury. Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation. Results: The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two–hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours). Conclusion: Machine learning applied to routinely collected ED data identified ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury up to 72 hours before they met diagnostic criteria. Further prospective evaluation is necessary. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088799436"

Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics—such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)—and brain tissue deformation-based metrics—such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods obtained significantly different (p < 0.01) values as well as substantial differences in injury classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data set of any size. The emulator and corresponding examples are available on our website1. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092428055"

We have used a supervised machine learning technique on past data of Indian Premier League matches to produce a ranking algorithm of batsmen of an ongoing season, which can be used to gauge a batsman's performance, or to compare between different batsmen.

Unlike static regression analyses that provide a momentary prediction, ML algorithms are dynamic in that they are readily capable of imbibing historical data to build a framework that improves with additive data. Purpose: To (1) characterize the epidemiology of publicly reported NHL injuries from 2007 to 2017, (2) determine the validity of a machine learning model in predicting next-season injury risk for both goalies and position players, and (3) compare the performance of modern ML algorithms versus logistic regression (LR) analyses. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Professional NHL player data were compiled for the years 2007 to 2017 from 2 publicly reported databases in the absence of an official NHL-approved database. Attributes acquired from each NHL player from each professional year included age, 85 performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 5 ML algorithms were created for both position player and goalie data: random forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Top 3 Ensemble. LR was also performed for both position player and goalie data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 2109 position players and 213 goalies. For models predicting next-season injury risk for position players, XGBoost performed the best with an AUC of 0.948, compared with an AUC of 0.937 for LR (P <.0001). For models predicting next-season injury risk for goalies, XGBoost had the highest AUC with 0.956, compared with an AUC of 0.947 for LR (P <.0001). Conclusion: Advanced ML models such as XGBoost outperformed LR and demonstrated good to excellent capability of predicting whether a publicly reportable injury is likely to occur the next season. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091463235"

A method to predict which individuals might be more susceptible to injury would be valuable, especially in the military where basic recruits may be discharged from service due to injury. We postulate that certain body characteristics may be used to predict risk of injury with physical activity. Methods US Army basic training recruits between the ages of 17 and 21 (N = 17,680, 28% female) were scanned for uniform fitting using the 3D body imaging scanner, Human Solutions of North America at Fort Jackson, SC. From the 3D body imaging scans, a database consisting of 161 anthropometric measurements per basic training recruit was used to predict the probability of discharge from the US Army due to injury. Predictions were made using logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Model comparison was done using the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC curve. Results The ANN model outperformed two other models, (ANN, AUC = 0.70, [0.68,0.72], logistic regression AUC = 0.67, [0.62,0.72], random forest AUC = 0.65, [0.61,0.70]). Conclusions Body shape profiles generated from a three-dimensional body scanning imaging in military personnel predicted dischargeable physical injury. The ANN model can be programmed into the scanner to deliver instantaneous predictions of risk, which may provide an opportunity to intervene to prevent injury. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087428040"

Here, we establish a network-based “response feature matrix” to characterize the magnitude and distribution of impact-induced brain strains. The network nodes and edges encode injury risks to the gray matter regions and their white matter interconnections, respectively. The utility of the metric is illustrated in injury prediction using three independent, real-world datasets: two reconstructed impact datasets from the National Football League (NFL) and Virginia Tech, respectively, and measured concussive and non-injury impacts from Stanford University. Injury predictions with leave-one-out cross-validation are conducted using the two reconstructed datasets separately, and then by combining all datasets into one. Using support vector machine, the network-based injury predictor consistently outperforms four baseline scalar metrics including peak maximum principal strain of the whole brain (MPS), peak linear/rotational acceleration, and peak rotational velocity across all five selected performance measures (e.g., maximized accuracy of 0.887 vs. 0.774 and 0.849 for MPS and rotational acceleration with corresponding positive predictive values of 0.938, 0.772, and 0.800, respectively, using the reconstructed NFL dataset). With sufficient training data, real-world injury prediction is similar to leave-one-out in-sample evaluation, suggesting the potential advantage of the network-based injury metric over conventional scalar metrics. The network-based response feature matrix significantly extends scalar metrics by sampling the brain strains more completely, which may serve as a useful framework potentially allowing for other applications such as characterizing injury patterns or facilitating targeted multi-scale modeling in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075343965"

The goalkeeper has to guess the ball flight trajectory within a fraction of a second and typically jumps to either side of the goalpost taking (often mistakenly) cues from the kicker. These cues are postulated in goalkeeper's mind based on the kicker's posture, run-up, and angle of attack at the ball. Statistical analysis of historical data helps pundits to identify beneficial strategies in such a competitive environment but these tactical knowledge is of marginal help to a novice soccer player for improving their penalty kickout and blocking skills. Oftentimes, players are not equally skilled at successfully placing the ball around different sections of the goalpost. To empower players with a retrospective view of their performance and identifying the strong versus weak shots, and blocking capabilities, it's crucial to detect the direction, force, and trajectory of the shots. In this work, we propose a wearable sensor-based approach to detect the outcome of various goal shots from the kicker's dominant foot movement profile. We empirically assign six hot-zones inside the goal post and collect data on a real-life penalty shoot-out using economically available accelerometer sensors from four participants. We develop a deep learning approach for the shot classification and we report superior (53%) accuracy over traditional approaches (47%) in a challenging setting of recognizing different goal shots from the segmented data stream. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091964322"

Therefore, machine learning-based Dili prediction can be key in increasing the success rate of drug discovery because drug candidates that are predicted to potentially induce liver injury can be rejected before clinical trials. However, existing Dili prediction models mainly focus on the chemical structures of drugs. Since we cannot determine whether a drug will cause liver injury based solely on its structure, Dili prediction based on the transcriptional effect of a drug on a cell is necessary. In this paper, we propose GLIT which is a model that uses transcriptional response data and chemical structures and can be used for drug-induced liver injury prediction. GLIT learns the embedding vectors of drug structures and drug-induced gene expression profiles using graph attention networks in a biological knowledge graph for predicting Dili. GLIT outperformed a baseline model that uses only drug structure information by 7% and 19.2% in terms of correct classification rate (CCR) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively. In addition, we conducted a literature survey to confirm whether the class labels of drugs, in the unknown Dili class, predicted by GLIT are correct. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084350975"

The objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements, especially living in the Big Data World. The NBA Draft Position case study was demonstrated to present this novel “STEAMS” concept as compared to the current “STEM” or” STEAM” approach. There are three core visions of this “STEAMS” methodology: (1) replace “Art” with “Artificial Intelligence”, (2) separate “Statistics” from “Math”, and (3) integrate all six “STEAMS” elements. Adding the “Artificial Intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “Sports” science research and “Math” algorithms. Separating the “Statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions. Due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “STEAMS” elements is becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern Big Data era. Several techniques are used to help determine the NBA Player position and identify the similar NBA players for the benchmarking objective. It’s critical and urgent for educators and teachers to abandon the traditional STEM approach to adopt the new “STEAMS” approach to educate our next generations in their early school learning and career development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105572424"

Purpose: To determine the validity of an ML model in predicting the next-season injury risk and anatomic injury location for both position players and pitchers in the MLB. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Using 4 online baseball databases, we compiled MLB player data, including age, performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 84 ML algorithms were developed. The output of each algorithm reported whether the player would sustain an injury the following season as well as the injury’s anatomic site. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation. Results: Player data were generated from 1931 position players and 1245 pitchers, with a mean follow-up of 4.40 years (13,982 player-years) between the years of 2000 and 2017. Injured players spent a total of 108,656 days on the disabled list, with a mean of 34.21 total days per player. The mean AUC for predicting next-season injuries was 0.76 among position players and 0.65 among pitchers using the top 3 ensemble classification. Back injuries had the highest AUC among both position players and pitchers, at 0.73. Advanced ML models outperformed logistic regression in 13 of 14 cases. Conclusion: Advanced ML models generally outperformed logistic regression and demonstrated fair capability in predicting publicly reportable next-season injuries, including the anatomic region for position players, although not for pitchers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095932170"

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has long been recognized as a common and important complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). In the study, machine learning (ML) techniques were used to establish predictive models for AKI in AP patients during hospitalization. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of AP patients admitted within one week after the onset of abdominal pain to our department from January 2014 to January 2019. Eighty patients developed AKI after admission (AKI group) and 254 patients did not (non-AKI group) in the hospital. With the provision of additional information such as demographic characteristics or laboratory data, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to build models of AKI prediction and compared to the predictive performance of the classic model using logistic regression (LR). XGBoost performed best in predicting AKI with an AUC of 91.93% among the machine learning models. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 87.28%. Present findings suggest that compared to the classical logistic regression model, machine learning models using features that can be easily obtained at admission had a better performance in predicting AKI in the AP patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093950127"

This paper focuses on data-driven defensive strategy learning in basketball. Most research to date on basketball strategylearning has focused on offensive effectiveness and is based on the interaction between the on-ball player and principleon-ball defender, thereby ignoring the contribution of the remaining players. Furthermore, most sports analytical systems that provide play-by-play data is heavily biased towards offensive metrics such as passes, dribbles, and shots. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning to classify the different defensive strategies basketball players adopt when deviating from their initial defensive action. An analytical model was developed to recognise the one-on-one (matched) relationships of the players, which is utilised to automatically identify any change of defensive strategy. A classification model is developed based on a player and ball tracking dataset from National Basketball Association (NBA) game play to classify the adopted defensive strategy against pick-and-roll play. The methodology described is the first toanalyse the defensive strategy of all in-game players (both on-ball players and off-ball players). The cross-validation results indicate that the proposed technique for automatic defensive strategy identification can achieve up to 69% accuracy of classification. Machine learning techniques, such as the one adopted here, have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of player decision making and defensive game strategies in basketball and other sports, by leveraging the player and ball tracking data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079221748"
